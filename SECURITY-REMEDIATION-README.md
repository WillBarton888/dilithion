## Quick Start

### For Immediate Deployment

1. **Review the security report:**
   ```bash
   cat SECURITY-FIXES-REPORT.md
   ```

2. **Apply patches to bash script:**
   ```bash
   # Follow instructions in:
   cat BASH-SECURITY-PATCHES.md
   ```

3. **Apply patches to batch script:**
   ```batch
   REM Follow instructions in:
   type BATCH-SECURITY-PATCHES.md
   ```

4. **Update documentation:**
   ```bash
   # Insert content from CLI-WALLET-SECURITY-WARNINGS.md
   # into the top of CLI-WALLET-GUIDE.md
   ```

5. **Run security tests:**
   ```bash
   ./test-wallet-security.sh
   ```

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### CRITICAL-1: Command Injection in Bash (Severity 10/10)

**Problem:** User input directly interpolated into JSON/shell commands  
**Fix:** Use jq for safe JSON construction with --arg parameters  
**Impact:** ELIMINATED command injection risk

### CRITICAL-2: Command Injection in Batch (Severity 10/10)

**Problem:** Direct variable interpolation in JSON strings  
**Fix:** Use secure temp files for JSON construction  
**Impact:** ELIMINATED command injection risk

### HIGH-1: No Address Validation (Severity 8/10)

**Problem:** No validation of cryptocurrency address format  
**Fix:** Comprehensive regex validation (prefix, length, character set)  
**Impact:** Invalid addresses rejected before sending

### HIGH-2: Inadequate Amount Validation (Severity 8/10)

**Problem:** Weak validation (allows zero, no upper bound, unlimited decimals)  
**Fix:** Strict format, range, and decimal validation  
**Impact:** Only valid amounts accepted

### HIGH-3: Insecure Temp Files (Severity 7/10)

**Problem:** Predictable temp file names  
**Fix:** Random filenames with proper cleanup  
**Impact:** Eliminated race condition and data exposure risks

## Testing

After applying all patches, run the security test suite:

```bash
chmod +x test-wallet-security.sh
./test-wallet-security.sh
```

Expected output:
```
Dilithion CLI Wallet Security Test Suite
==========================================

ADDRESS VALIDATION TESTS
------------------------
TEST: Reject too short address ... PASS (correctly rejected)
TEST: Reject wrong prefix ... PASS (correctly rejected)
...

TEST SUMMARY
==========================================
Passed: 15
Failed: 0

ALL TESTS PASSED - Security validations working correctly
```

## Manual Verification

### Test Address Validation

```bash
# Should reject (too short)
./dilithion-wallet send "DLT" 10

# Should reject (wrong prefix)
./dilithion-wallet send "ABC123..." 10

# Should reject (special characters)
./dilithion-wallet send "DLT1@#$..." 10
```

### Test Amount Validation

```bash
# Should reject (zero)
./dilithion-wallet send "DLT1validaddress..." 0

# Should reject (negative)
./dilithion-wallet send "DLT1validaddress..." -10

# Should reject (too many decimals)
./dilithion-wallet send "DLT1validaddress..." 10.123456789
```

### Test Command Injection Protection

```bash
# Should be safely rejected
./dilithion-wallet send 'DLT1";rm -rf /;echo"' 10
./dilithion-wallet send 'DLT1`whoami`' 10
./dilithion-wallet send 'DLT1$(cat /etc/passwd)' 10
```

All injection attempts should be safely rejected by validation.
