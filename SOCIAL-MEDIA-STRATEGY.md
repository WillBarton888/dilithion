# Social Media Strategy for Testnet Launch

## The Question: New Accounts or Personal Accounts?

You have two options for the testnet launch:

---

## Option 1: Start with Personal/Existing Accounts (Recommended for Testnet)

### ✅ Pros:
- **Immediate reach** - leverage existing followers/network
- **Faster launch** - post today, no setup delays
- **Less overhead** - don't need to build new accounts from zero
- **Authentic** - personal story of building Dilithion
- **Testnet is experimental** - less pressure for "official" branding

### ⚠️ Cons:
- Mixes personal and project content
- Harder for users to find "official" Dilithion channel later

### Best For:
- Quick testnet launch NOW
- Getting initial feedback from trusted network
- Testing the waters before full commitment

---

## Option 2: Create Dedicated Brand Accounts

### ✅ Pros:
- **Professional appearance** - looks more legitimate
- **Clear official channel** - community knows where to go
- **Separation** - keeps personal and project separate
- **Long-term branding** - builds Dilithion identity
- **Easier for exchanges/media** - clear official source

### ⚠️ Cons:
- **Zero followers** - starting from scratch
- **Takes time** - need to build credibility
- **More accounts to manage** - additional overhead
- **Delayed launch** - need to set up before posting

### Best For:
- Mainnet launch (definitely need these)
- Long-term project with big ambitions
- Professional appearance from day one

## My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach 🎯

**For Testnet Launch (Now):**

1. **Use personal/existing accounts** to announce testnet
   - Post on your personal Twitter/Reddit
   - Mention "by Will Barton" in posts
   - Link to GitHub (that's the official source)
   - Get immediate feedback from network

2. **GitHub is your official channel**
   - GitHub repo is the source of truth
   - Discussions tab = community hub
   - No need for social media to be "official" yet

**For Mainnet Launch (Later):**

1. **Create dedicated accounts:**
   - Twitter: @DilithionCrypto or @DilithionCoin
   - Reddit: r/Dilithion (subreddit)
   - Discord: Dilithion server
   - Telegram: Dilithion group

2. **Build gradually during testnet phase**
   - 3-6 months to grow following organically
   - By mainnet, you'll have established presence

## Testnet Launch Strategy (Recommended)

### Phase 1: NOW (Personal Accounts)
```
✅ Post on your personal Twitter (if you have one)
✅ Post on Reddit (your personal account)
✅ Post on relevant forums (BitcoinTalk, etc.)
✅ Email crypto communities you're part of

Message focus:
"I've been building Dilithion, a post-quantum cryptocurrency.
 Just launched testnet. Looking for testers and feedback."
```

### Phase 2: Week 2-4 (Evaluate)
```
- See how much engagement you get
- Decide if project justifies dedicated accounts
- Community might create unofficial channels (Discord, Telegram)
```

### Phase 3: Month 2-3 (Brand Building)
```
IF testnet is successful:
- Create @DilithionCrypto Twitter
- Create r/Dilithion subreddit
- Set up Discord server
- Announce: "Official channels now live"
```

### Phase 4: Mainnet Launch (Full Branding)
```
- All official accounts established
- Community grown organically
- Professional presence ready
```

---

## Quick Decision Matrix

**If you want to launch TODAY:**
→ Use personal accounts (post now, create brand accounts later)

**If you can wait 1-2 days:**
→ Create dedicated accounts first (more professional)

**If testnet is just experimental:**
→ Personal accounts are fine (GitHub is the official source)

**If you're committed to mainnet:**
→ Create brand accounts now (build following during testnet)

---

## Accounts to Consider Creating

### Essential (Create These if Going Option 2):
- [ ] Twitter/X: @DilithionCrypto
- [ ] Reddit: r/Dilithion (subreddit requires 30+ karma to create)

### Optional (Can Wait):
- [ ] Discord server
- [ ] Telegram group
- [ ] Medium blog
- [ ] YouTube channel

### Not Needed Yet:
- Instagram (not crypto-focused)
- Facebook (declining crypto community)
- TikTok (unless you want to do video content)

## My Specific Recommendation for YOU

Given:
- ✅ Testnet is experimental ("93% test pass, seeking feedback")
- ✅ AI-assisted development (full disclosure = personal project vibe)
- ✅ GitHub is your primary platform (already professional)
- ✅ You want to launch soon (momentum is important)

**Recommended Path:**

1. **TODAY - Post with personal accounts**
   - Reddit: Post to r/CryptoCurrency, r/CryptoTechnology (use your account)
   - Twitter: Post from personal account (if you have one)
   - BitcoinTalk: Create thread (can be personal or project name)
   - Message: "I built Dilithion, seeking testnet feedback"

2. **WEEK 2 - Create official accounts (if testnet gains traction)**
   - Twitter: @DilithionCrypto
   - Announce in GitHub Discussions: "Official accounts now live"
   - Repost testnet updates on official accounts

3. **MONTH 2+ - Expand to Discord/Telegram (if community grows)**
   - Only if you have active community that needs real-time chat
   - Don't create empty Discord server (looks bad)

---

## Templates Updated

All templates in TESTNET-ANNOUNCEMENT-TEMPLATES.md work for either:
- Personal accounts (just post as yourself)
- Brand accounts (post as @DilithionCrypto)

Just adjust the tone:
- **Personal**: "I've been building..."
- **Brand**: "Dilithion is now..."

---

## Bottom Line

**For testnet: Personal accounts are FINE.**

GitHub is your official source. Social media is just for spreading the word.

**For mainnet: Definitely need brand accounts.**

You have 3-6 months during testnet to set those up properly.

---

## What to Do RIGHT NOW

**Quick Launch (Recommended):**

1. Open TESTNET-ANNOUNCEMENT-TEMPLATES.md
2. Copy Reddit template for r/CryptoCurrency
3. Post to Reddit with YOUR account
4. Copy Twitter template (if you have Twitter)
5. Post to Twitter with YOUR account
6. Link to GitHub repo in all posts

**GitHub is the official source. You're just spreading the word.**

---

**Decision**: Do you want to post today with personal accounts, or wait 1-2 days to set up brand accounts first?

For testnet, I recommend: **Post today, build brand later.** ✅

**Momentum > Perfect branding for an experimental testnet.**
