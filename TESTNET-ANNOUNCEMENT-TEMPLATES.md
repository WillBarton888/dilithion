## 📱 Reddit Announcement

### For r/cryptocurrency:
```markdown
# Dilithion Testnet Launch: Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency Now Live for Testing

Hey r/cryptocurrency! I'm excited to announce the public testnet launch of **Dilithion**, a post-quantum cryptocurrency built from scratch.

## What is Dilithion?

Dilithion is a quantum-resistant cryptocurrency using NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography:

- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium3** signatures (NIST PQC standard)
- **SHA3-256** hashing (quantum-resistant)
- **RandomX** proof-of-work (CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant)
- **Full UTXO model** (like Bitcoin)

## Why Post-Quantum?

Quantum computers are coming, and they'll break current cryptocurrencies. "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks mean adversaries are already collecting encrypted data to decrypt when quantum computers arrive. Dilithion is quantum-safe from day one.

## What's Been Done

- ✅ **4 phases of security hardening** complete
- ✅ **93% test pass rate** (13/14 tests)
- ✅ **All critical bugs fixed** (UTXO serialization, wallet unlock, DNS seeds)
- ✅ **Open source** (MIT license)
- ✅ **AI-assisted development** (full disclosure - built with Claude Code)

## Join the Testnet

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WillBarton888/dilithion.git
cd dilithion
make
./dilithion-node --mine --threads=4
```

**Subject**: Dilithion Testnet Launch - Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency Now Testing

```
Hi [Community Name],

I'm excited to announce the public testnet launch of Dilithion, a post-quantum cryptocurrency built from scratch.

WHAT IS DILITHION?
Dilithion uses NIST-approved CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 signatures and RandomX proof-of-work to create a quantum-resistant cryptocurrency. Unlike most cryptocurrencies today, Dilithion will remain secure even when large-scale quantum computers become available.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- Quantum computers pose an existential threat to current cryptocurrencies
- "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks are already happening
- Post-quantum crypto needs to be deployed NOW, not after quantum computers arrive

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ 93% test pass rate (13/14 tests passing)
✅ All critical bugs fixed
✅ Security hardening complete (4 phases)
✅ Open source (MIT license)
✅ Ready for community testing

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Dilithion Launches Public Testnet for Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency

Open-source project invites community to test NIST-approved quantum-resistant blockchain

[CITY, STATE] - October 28, 2025 - Dilithion, an open-source post-quantum cryptocurrency project, today announced the launch of its public testnet. The project aims to create a quantum-resistant alternative to existing cryptocurrencies using NIST-approved CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 signatures.

With large-scale quantum computers projected to become available within the next decade, current cryptocurrencies face an existential threat. Dilithion addresses this vulnerability by implementing post-quantum cryptography from the ground up, rather than attempting to retrofit existing systems.

"The quantum threat to cryptocurrency is real and imminent," said Will Barton, lead developer. "We're building Dilithion to be quantum-safe from day one, using NIST-standard algorithms that will remain secure even when large-scale quantum computers arrive."

KEY FEATURES:
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 post-quantum signatures (NIST-approved)
- RandomX proof-of-work (CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant)
- Full UTXO transaction model
- Open source (MIT license)
- 93% test pass rate

The testnet launch follows four phases of security hardening and comprehensive bug fixes. The project is seeking community participation in testing, bug hunting, and code review before a planned mainnet launch in 3-6 months.

ABOUT DILITHION:
Dilithion is an experimental cryptocurrency project developed with AI assistance and released under an open-source MIT license. The project emphasizes transparency, including full disclosure of its AI-assisted development process and plans for external security audits before mainnet launch.

TESTNET PARTICIPATION:
Community members can join the testnet at: https://github.com/WillBarton888/dilithion

DISCLAIMER:
Dilithion is experimental software with no professional security audit yet. Testnet coins have no monetary value. This is for testing purposes only.
