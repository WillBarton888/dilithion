## Critical Incident Procedures

### 1. Private Key Compromise

**If private keys are exposed:**

```
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Post urgent warning: "CRITICAL: Do not use Dilithion wallet until further notice"
2. Identify how keys were exposed (code bug, file permissions, etc.)
3. Develop fix for key storage/handling
4. Users must generate NEW keys after fix
5. Old addresses considered compromised
```

**Communication Template:**
```
ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT ðŸ”´

A vulnerability has been discovered that may expose private keys.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
- Stop using your current Dilithion wallet
- Do not transact until patch is released
- Monitor [channel] for updates

We are working on a fix. ETA: [timeframe]

Details: [brief description without exposing vulnerability]
```

---

### 2. Consensus Bug (Double-Spend)

**If double-spend is possible:**

```
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Verify the bug exists and document
2. Post critical alert to all miners
3. Request voluntary network pause if possible
4. Develop consensus fix
5. Coordinate simultaneous deployment
6. May require chain rollback to before exploit
```

**This is WORST CASE. Prevention is critical.**

---

### 3. Network Halt

**If blocks stop being produced:**

```
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Check if it's a difficulty bomb or mining issue
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Check if miners are crashing
4. Post status update
5. Emergency difficulty adjustment if needed
6. Debug mining software
```

---

### 4. 51% Attack

**If single entity controls majority hashrate:**

```
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Monitor for double-spends
2. Identify attacking entity if possible
3. Post alert to community
4. Coordinate with honest miners
5. Consider emergency response (controversial)
6. Document all malicious blocks
```

**Note:** As CPU-mined coin, 51% attack is easier than ASIC coins. This is a known risk.

---

### 5. Critical Vulnerability Disclosure

**If someone reports a critical bug:**

```
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Thank reporter privately
2. Request responsible disclosure (don't publish yet)
3. Verify the vulnerability
4. Develop fix in private
5. Test fix thoroughly
6. Deploy to network
7. After fix is deployed, publish disclosure
8. Pay bug bounty to reporter
```

**Never ignore or dismiss security reports.**

## Communication Procedures

### Public Disclosure

**Before fix deployed:**
```markdown
We are aware of a security issue affecting [component].

Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
Impact: [Brief description]
Status: Patch in development
ETA: [Timeframe]

Recommended Action: [What users should do]

Updates will be posted here: [Channel]
```

**After fix deployed:**
```markdown
SECURITY UPDATE: Version [X.X.X] Released

A [severity] vulnerability has been patched.

What was affected: [Description]
Who is impacted: [Users/Miners/Everyone]
Action required: Update to version [X.X.X] immediately

Update instructions: [Link]

Credit: [Researcher name if they want credit]
```

## Code Deployment Procedures

### Emergency Patch Process

1. **Develop Fix**
   - Work with Claude to create patch
   - Test thoroughly (even in emergency)
   - Document what changed

2. **Build Release**
   - Compile patched binaries
   - Test on testnet first if possible
   - Generate checksums

3. **Notify Network**
   - Post to all channels
   - Contact major miners directly
   - Provide update instructions

4. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Track adoption rate
   - Verify fix works in production
   - Watch for new issues

5. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document incident
   - Analyze root cause
   - Prevent future occurrence

---

## Data Collection During Incident

### What to Collect:
- Log files from affected nodes
- Network traffic captures (if relevant)
- Screenshots of errors
- Blockchain state at time of incident
- Steps to reproduce
- User reports

### Where to Store:
- Private GitHub repository (for security issues)
- Encrypted backup
- Incident documentation folder

**Never publicly post sensitive security details before fix is deployed.**

---

## Rollback Procedures

### When Rollback is Justified:
- Consensus bug exploited
- Major funds stolen due to bug
- Blockchain in invalid state

### How to Execute:
1. Achieve community consensus (this is controversial)
2. Identify last good block
3. Coordinate with all miners
4. Deploy rollback code
5. Restart from last good block
6. Monitor for issues

**WARNING:** Rollbacks are extremely controversial. Use only as absolute last resort.

## Testing Emergency Response

### Quarterly Drills:
- [ ] Test communication channels work
- [ ] Verify you can build and deploy emergency patches
- [ ] Practice incident response with simulated scenarios
- [ ] Update contact information

### Tabletop Exercises:
- "Private keys leaked - what do you do?"
- "Mining stops - how do you respond?"
- "Someone claims double-spend - what's your process?"

---

## Post-Incident Review

### Required After Every P0/P1 Incident:

1. **Timeline Documentation**
   - When was issue discovered?
   - When was response initiated?
   - When was fix deployed?
   - When was incident resolved?

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - What was the bug?
   - How did it get into code?
   - Why wasn't it caught in testing?

3. **Lessons Learned**
   - What went well?
   - What went poorly?
   - What should change?

4. **Prevention**
   - Add tests to prevent recurrence
   - Update review checklist
   - Improve monitoring
