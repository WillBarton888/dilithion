## üêõ Critical Fixes in This Release

### Security & Consensus Fixes (Oct 26, 2025)
1. **Fixed hash comparison byte order** (genesis.cpp:87)
   - Changed from little-endian memcmp to big-endian HashLessThan()
   - Prevents invalid genesis block that would fail consensus

2. **Standardized target calculation** (genesis_test.cpp:75)
   - Removed custom GetTargetFromBits() function
   - Now uses consensus CompactToBig() for consistency

3. **Added post-mining verification** (genesis.cpp:95)
   - Verifies mined nonce with CheckProofOfWork()
   - Catches any remaining mining bugs before commit

4. **Fixed missing include** (server.h:10)
   - Added #include <rpc/ratelimiter.h>
   - Resolves compilation error

**Impact:** These fixes prevented a catastrophic mainnet failure. Without them, the genesis block would have been invalid and the network would never start.

### Wallet Security Improvements (Oct 26, 2025)
- Compiler-proof memory wiping for encryption keys
- PBKDF2-SHA3 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- RPC rate limiting (60 requests/minute, 5 failure lockout)
- Secure random number generation
