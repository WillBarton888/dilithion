# Dilithion Emission Schedule - Updated for 4-Minute Blocks

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Block Time:** 4 minutes (240 seconds)
**Status:** Final schedule for mainnet launch

---

## Executive Summary

With the **4-minute block time**, Dilithion's emission schedule is **significantly improved** compared to the original 2-minute plan:

- **First halving:** ~1.6 years (vs ~8 months with 2-min blocks)
- **Second halving:** ~3.2 years (vs ~1.6 years)
- **99% mined:** ~12.8 years (vs ~6.4 years)

This creates a **more balanced distribution** that's better for long-term sustainability while still being faster than Bitcoin.

## Advantages of 4-Minute Emission

### Compared to Original 2-Minute Plan

**1. More Balanced Distribution** ✅
```
2-min blocks: 62.6% mined in Year 1 (too fast)
4-min blocks: 31.3% mined in Year 1 (better pace)
```

**2. Lower Inflation Pressure** ✅
```
2-min: 36,000 DIL/day in Year 1
4-min: 18,000 DIL/day in Year 1 (50% less selling pressure)
```

**3. Longer Price Discovery Period** ✅
```
2-min: First halving after 10 months (very fast)
4-min: First halving after 19 months (reasonable time for market maturity)
```

**4. Better Long-term Sustainability** ✅
```
2-min: Fee-dependent by Year 4
4-min: Fee-dependent by Year 8 (more time to develop fee market)
```

**5. More Time for Adoption** ✅
```
More gradual distribution = More time for:
- Exchange listings
- Wallet development
- Community growth
- Ecosystem building
```

## Comparison to Other Cryptocurrencies

| Coin | Block Time | First Halving | 99% Mined | Year 1 % | Strategy |
|------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Bitcoin** | 10 min | 4.0 years | ~32 years | 12.5% | Very slow, steady |
| **Litecoin** | 2.5 min | 4.0 years | ~32 years | 12.5% | Slow, steady |
| **Monero** | 2 min | Tail emission | Never | ~20% | Perpetual emission |
| **Dilithion** | **4 min** | **1.6 years** | **~12.8 years** | **31.3%** | **Moderate-fast** |
| Dilithion (2-min) | 2 min | 0.8 years | ~6.4 years | 62.6% | Too aggressive |

**Positioning:** Dilithion (4-min) sits between Bitcoin's ultra-conservative approach and overly aggressive alternatives.

## Miner Economics Over Time

### Block Rewards + Fees Projection

**Assumptions:**
- 10 transactions per block (conservative)
- Average fee: 0.0015 DIL per transaction (after Option A increase)
- Total fees per block: 0.015 DIL

| Year | Block Reward | Fees/Block | Total/Block | % from Fees | Blocks/Day | Daily Total |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Year 1** | 50.000 DIL | 0.015 DIL | 50.015 DIL | 0.03% | 360 | 18,005 DIL |
| **Year 2** | 50→25 DIL | 0.015 DIL | ~37.5 DIL | ~0.04% | 360 | ~13,500 DIL |
| **Year 3** | 25.000 DIL | 0.015 DIL | 25.015 DIL | 0.06% | 360 | 9,005 DIL |
| **Year 5** | 12.500 DIL | 0.015 DIL | 12.515 DIL | 0.12% | 360 | 4,505 DIL |
| **Year 10** | 3.125 DIL | 0.030 DIL* | 3.155 DIL | 0.95% | 360 | 1,136 DIL |
| **Year 20** | 0.098 DIL | 0.050 DIL* | 0.148 DIL | 33.8% | 360 | 53 DIL |

*Assuming increased transaction volume and/or dynamic fees in future years

**Observation:** Fees become important after Year 10, critical after Year 20.

## Risk Analysis

### Inflation Risk: MODERATE ⚠️

**Year 1 Inflation:**
- 31.3% of total supply mined in first year
- 18,000 DIL/day new supply
- Creates selling pressure from miners

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Much better than 62.6% with 2-min blocks
- ✅ Similar to many successful altcoins
- ✅ Transparent and predictable schedule
- ✅ Early adopters properly rewarded

---

### Fee Dependency Risk: MODERATE ⚠️

**Timeline to Fee Dependency:**
- Year 5: Block reward 12.5 DIL (fees still <1%)
- Year 10: Block reward 3.125 DIL (fees need to be ~1%)
- Year 15: Block reward 0.78 DIL (fees need to be ~10%+)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ 2x longer timeline than 2-min blocks (8 years vs 4 years)
- 🔄 Plan to implement dynamic fees (Year 1-2)
- 🔄 Expect DIL price appreciation (10-100x)
- 🔄 Expect transaction volume growth

---

### Distribution Risk: LOW ✅

**Fair Launch:**
- ✅ No premine
- ✅ No ICO
- ✅ Pure proof-of-work
- ✅ Transparent schedule
- ✅ Accessible CPU mining (RandomX)

**Timeline Fairness:**
- ✅ 1.6 years to first halving (enough time for discovery)
- ✅ 6.4 years to 75% mined (reasonable distribution period)
- ✅ 12.8 years to 99% mined (long-term commitment)

---

## Marketing Implications

### Messaging for Different Audiences

**For Miners:**
> "Dilithion offers CPU-friendly mining with fair block rewards. With 4-minute blocks and 50 DIL per block, early miners earn 18,000 DIL daily. First halving isn't until Year 2, giving you plenty of time to build your mining operation."

**For Investors:**
> "Dilithion's 4-minute block time creates a balanced emission schedule—fast enough to establish network security quickly, but gradual enough to allow proper price discovery. 31% mined in Year 1 (vs Bitcoin's 12.5%) rewards early adopters while maintaining long-term sustainability."

**For Developers:**
> "With ~12.8 years to mine 99% of supply and halvings every 1.6 years, Dilithion provides a predictable economic model for building applications. The 4-minute block time offers 2.5x faster confirmations than Bitcoin while maintaining adequate security."
