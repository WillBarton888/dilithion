## How to Apply Fixes

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Read the master guide:**
   ```bash
   cat SECURITY-REMEDIATION-README.md
   ```

2. **Apply bash patches:**
   ```bash
   # Follow step-by-step instructions in:
   cat BASH-SECURITY-PATCHES.md
   ```

3. **Apply batch patches:**
   ```batch
   REM Follow step-by-step instructions in:
   type BATCH-SECURITY-PATCHES.md
   ```

4. **Update documentation:**
   ```bash
   # Insert CLI-WALLET-SECURITY-WARNINGS.md content
   # at the top of CLI-WALLET-GUIDE.md (after title)
   ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x test-wallet-security.sh
   ./test-wallet-security.sh
   ```

### Detailed Instructions

Each patch file contains:
- Exact line numbers
- Complete code to add
- Explanation of each fix
- Security impact

### Verification

After applying patches, the test suite will verify:
- Address validation (rejects invalid formats)
- Amount validation (rejects zero, negative, excessive)
- Command injection protection (neutralizes attacks)
- Argument validation (requires all parameters)

## Security Improvements

### Before Remediation

```bash
# VULNERABLE: Direct interpolation
response=$(rpc_call "sendtoaddress" "{\"address\":\"$address\",\"amount\":$amount}")

# NO address validation
# NO amount range checking
# NO timeout protection
# WEAK confirmation
```

### After Remediation

```bash
# SECURE: jq-based construction
validate_address "$address" || exit 3      # Comprehensive validation
validate_amount "$amount" || exit 4        # Range and format checks
response=$(rpc_call_sendtoaddress "$address" "$amount")  # Safe JSON

# WITH timeouts (30s max, 10s connect)
# WITH enhanced warnings and checklist
# WITH proper error handling
```
