## Score Interpretation

### 25-30 points: READY TO PROCEED ✅

**You are ready for Week 2 (Going Public)!**

You have solid understanding of the technology, practical skills to operate the software, and the right mindset for responsible experimental launch.

**Next step:** Begin WEEK-2-ACTION-PLAN.md on November 3, 2025

**Recommendation:** Review any topics where you scored below 7/10 before going public.

---

### 20-24 points: PROCEED WITH CAUTION ⚠️

**You have foundational knowledge but some gaps remain.**

**Before proceeding to Week 2:**
1. Identify your lowest-scoring areas
2. Re-read those sections from Days 1-7
3. Practice the practical skills you marked NO
4. Retake this assessment

**Recommendation:** Take 2-3 extra days to strengthen weak areas, then retake exam.

---

### 15-19 points: NOT READY YET ❌

**Significant knowledge gaps exist that could cause problems during launch.**

**Before proceeding:**
1. Re-study Days 1-7 materials thoroughly
2. Read through the actual code files again
3. Practice running the node, mining, creating transactions
4. Work through POST-QUANTUM-CRYPTO-COURSE.md modules with quizzes

**Recommendation:** Take 1-2 weeks additional study, then retake exam. Do NOT go public until you score 25+.

---

### Below 15 points: DO NOT LAUNCH 🛑

**Fundamental gaps in understanding exist.**

**Honest assessment:** You may not be ready to launch a cryptocurrency yet. This isn't a failure - it's responsible self-awareness.

**Options:**
1. **Extended study:** Take 1-2 months to deeply learn blockchain technology
2. **Find a co-developer:** Partner with someone who has blockchain experience
3. **Research project only:** Open-source the code as a learning project, not a live currency
4. **Delay indefinitely:** Wait until you're truly ready

**Remember:** Launching before you're ready puts users at risk. There's no shame in waiting.
