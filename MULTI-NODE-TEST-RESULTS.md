## Known Limitations (Expected)

### 1. No Incoming Connection Logging ⚠️

**Observation**: Terminal 1 did not show `[P2P] New peer connected` messages when Node 2 connected.

**Explanation**: This is a known limitation documented in PATH-A-COMPLETION-REPORT.md. The outbound connection works (Node 2 shows `✓ Connected`), but the full bidirectional message exchange isn't implemented yet. The accept loop needs additional logging or the connection manager needs message passing implementation.

**Impact**: LOW - Connections are established (proven by successful `Connect` messages), just not logged on the listening side.

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Will be addressed in message exchange implementation phase.

### 2. No Message Exchange ⚠️

**Observation**: Nodes connect but don't exchange protocol messages (version/verack/ping/pong).

**Explanation**: This phase (Path A) focused on socket server infrastructure. Message exchange is next phase.

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Nodes can't yet synchronize blocks or transactions.

**Priority**: HIGH - Required for blockchain synchronization.

### 3. Limited IP Parsing ⚠️

**Observation**: Only tested with 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

**Explanation**: Current implementation only handles "127.0.0.1" and "localhost" in IP parsing.

**Impact**: LOW for local testing, MEDIUM for internet-wide deployment.

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Required for mainnet but not blocking current testnet work.

## Issues Encountered and Resolved ✅

### Issue 1: Database Lock Conflict
**Problem**: Node 2 initially tried to use same data directory as Node 1.
```
Failed to open database: IO error: lock .dilithion-testnet/blocks/LOCK: Resource temporarily unavailable
```

**Solution**: Added `--datadir=.dilithion-testnet-2` flag.

**Resolution**: ✅ RESOLVED - Each node now uses separate data directory.

### Issue 2: Missing Data Directory
**Problem**: Data directories didn't exist initially.
```
Failed to open database: NotFound: .dilithion-testnet-2/blocks/LOCK: No such file or directory
```

**Solution**: Created directories with `mkdir -p .dilithion-testnet-N/blocks` before starting nodes.

**Resolution**: ✅ RESOLVED - All nodes now have proper data directories.

### Issue 3: Command Line Parsing Error
**Problem**: Missing space before --datadir flag caused incorrect parsing.
```
Connect to: 127.0.0.1:18444--datadir=.dilithion-testnet-2
```

**Solution**: Ensured proper spacing in command: `18444 --datadir` (not `18444--datadir`).

**Resolution**: ✅ RESOLVED - Proper command-line formatting.

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Priority 1: Message Exchange Implementation (HIGH)
**Objective**: Enable nodes to exchange protocol messages
**Tasks**:
1. Implement send/receive message loops
2. Add version/verack handshake
3. Implement ping/pong keepalive
4. Add connection state tracking

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Why Important**: Required for actual P2P communication

### Priority 2: Block Propagation (HIGH)
**Objective**: Enable blockchain synchronization between nodes
**Tasks**:
1. Implement block announcement (inv messages)
2. Add block request/response (getdata/block)
3. Validate received blocks
4. Update blockchain state

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Why Important**: Core cryptocurrency functionality

### Priority 3: Mining Block Template Fix (HIGH - from Path B)
**Objective**: Enable actual mining on testnet
**Tasks**:
1. Implement proper coinbase transaction
2. Calculate target from nBits
3. Set merkle root correctly
4. Wire up to blockchain state

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Why Important**: Needed to create new blocks for testing
