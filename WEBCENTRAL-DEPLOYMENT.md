4. Enable SSL for dilithion.org
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
6. Test: https://dilithion.org/

### Force HTTPS Redirect

Create `.htaccess` file in `public_html`:

```apache
# Force HTTPS
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

**How to create:**
1. In FileZilla: Right-click ‚Üí Create new file ‚Üí `.htaccess`
2. Paste the content above
3. Save and upload
