## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, you should:

1. **Read the documentation:**
   - [README.md](README.md)
   - [Technical Specification](docs/technical-specification.md)
   - [Implementation Roadmap](docs/implementation-roadmap.md)

2. **Set up your environment:**

### Not Accepting Contributions Yet

**⚠️ Important:** We are currently in Foundation Phase (Month 0-3) and **not yet accepting external contributions**.

**We will open for contributions after:**
- Proof-of-concept is complete
- Core cryptographic implementation is functional
- Testing framework is established
- Contribution workflows are defined

**Expected Timeline:** Month 4-6 (early 2026)

---

## Development Process

### Current Phase: Foundation (Closed)

**Focus:** Core team is establishing:
- Technical architecture
- Cryptographic implementation
- Testing framework
- Development workflows

**Status:** Internal development only

### Future: Open Development (Planned)

When we open for contributions:

1. **Find an Issue:**
   - Check GitHub Issues
   - Look for `good-first-issue` labels
   - Ask in discussion channels

2. **Discuss First:**
   - Comment on the issue
   - Propose your approach
   - Get feedback before coding

3. **Develop:**
   - Fork the repository
   - Create a feature branch
   - Write code and tests
   - Follow code standards

4. **Submit:**
   - Create pull request
   - Address review feedback
   - Get approval from reviewers
   - Merge when ready

### Communication Channels

**Primary:**
- GitHub Issues (technical discussion)
- GitHub Discussions (general topics)

**Future:**
- IRC/Matrix (to be determined)
- Developer mailing list (to be determined)

**Not Used:**
- Discord (too centralized)
- Telegram (not suitable for development)
- Slack (not public enough)

---

## Code Standards

### Bitcoin Core Style

Follow Bitcoin Core coding standards:

**C++ Guidelines:**
```cpp
// Use Bitcoin Core naming conventions
class CKey {          // Classes: CamelCase with C prefix
    bool fValid;      // Members: camelCase with type prefix
    void SetValid();  // Methods: CamelCase
};

// Use Bitcoin Core patterns
CAmount nAmount = 0;  // Amount with n prefix
int64_t nTime = 0;    // Time with n prefix
std::vector<unsigned char> vch;  // Vector with v prefix

// Comments
// Single line comments use //
/* Multi-line comments
   use this style */

// No trailing whitespace
// No tabs (use 4 spaces)
// Max 120 characters per line
```

**Documentation:**
```cpp
/**
 * Brief description of function
 *
 * Detailed description explaining what the function does,
 * its parameters, return value, and any side effects.
 *
 * @param[in] param1 Description of param1
 * @param[out] param2 Description of param2
 * @return Description of return value
 *
 * @note Any important notes
 * @warning Any warnings
 */
ReturnType FunctionName(Type1 param1, Type2& param2);
```

### Security-Critical Code

For cryptographic and consensus code, follow:
- `.claude/standards/security-critical-code.md`
- Constant-time operations
- Proper memory management
- Comprehensive testing

### Commit Messages

**Format:**
```
Brief summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation (if needed). Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain WHY the change was made, not just WHAT changed.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues (#123)
```

**Examples:**

Good:
```
Implement Dilithium signature verification

Add constant-time Dilithium signature verification using
pqcrystals reference implementation. Includes comprehensive
unit tests and validation against NIST test vectors.

Closes #42
```

Bad:
```
fixed stuff
```

```
wip
```

## Testing Requirements

### All Code Must Be Tested

**No exceptions.** Every contribution must include tests.

### Test Types

#### 1. Unit Tests (Required)

```cpp
// src/test/dilithium_tests.cpp
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(dilithium_signature_verification) {
    CKey key;
    key.MakeNewKey();

    uint256 hash = Hash("test");
    std::vector<unsigned char> sig;
    BOOST_CHECK(key.Sign(hash, sig));

    CPubKey pubkey = key.GetPubKey();
    BOOST_CHECK(pubkey.Verify(hash, sig));
}
```

#### 2. Functional Tests (When Applicable)

```python
# test/functional/feature_dilithium.py
def run_test(self):
    # Test that nodes accept Dilithium transactions
    tx = self.create_dilithium_transaction()
    self.nodes[0].sendrawtransaction(tx)
    self.sync_all()
```

#### 3. Fuzz Tests (For Parsers)

```cpp
// src/test/fuzz/dilithium.cpp
void test_one_input(const std::vector<uint8_t>& buffer) {
    // Should not crash on any input
    CPubKey pubkey;
    pubkey.Deserialize(buffer);
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
make check

# Functional tests
test/functional/test_runner.py

# Specific test
./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=dilithium_tests
```

### Coverage Requirements

- New code: 100% line coverage
- Modified code: Maintain or improve coverage
- Critical code: 100% branch coverage
