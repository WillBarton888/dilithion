# Technical Pivot Plan: From Bitcoin Fork to New Blockchain

**Context:** Project is a NEW cryptocurrency, not Bitcoin upgrade
**Timeline:** Launch Q4 2025
**Focus:** Mining accessibility for retail public

---

## Critical Technical Decisions NOW

### Decision 1: Mining Algorithm ⚠️ URGENT

**Current:** We're building on Bitcoin Core codebase (SHA-256 mining)

**Problem:** SHA-256 requires ASICs - excludes retail miners

**Options:**

#### Option A: RandomX (RECOMMENDED)
```
✅ CPU-friendly (laptops can mine)
✅ ASIC-resistant (proven with Monero)
✅ Fair launch (everyone equal access)
❌ Different from Bitcoin (more work to implement)

Implementation effort: 2-3 weeks
Fair launch value: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

#### Option B: SHA-256 (Current)
```
✅ Already implemented
✅ Simple, proven
❌ ASIC-dominated (kills "second chance" narrative)
❌ Only rich can mine (defeats purpose)

Implementation effort: 0 weeks (done)
Fair launch value: ⭐ (FAILS core mission)
```

#### Option C: Hybrid SHA-256 + Memory-Hard
```
✅ Keeps some Bitcoin DNA
✅ More ASIC-resistant
⚠️ Complex, unproven
❌ Middling solution (neither fish nor fowl)

Implementation effort: 3-4 weeks
Fair launch value: ⭐⭐⭐
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Switch to RandomX immediately**

**Why:** The entire value proposition is "second chance Bitcoin for regular people." If only ASIC farms can mine, the narrative fails on day 1.

**Cost:** 2-3 weeks development time
**Benefit:** Saves the entire project concept

---

### Decision 2: Codebase Direction

**Current:** Bitcoin Core v25 fork with Dilithium additions

**Two Paths:**

#### Path A: Continue Bitcoin Core Fork (Current)
```
Advantages:
✅ Most work already done (Sessions 1-18)
✅ Proven, stable codebase
✅ Familiar to Bitcoin developers
✅ Easier to review/audit

Disadvantages:
❌ Tons of Bitcoin-specific code we don't need
❌ Complex codebase (500k+ lines)
❌ Harder to customize for our needs
❌ Mining algorithm change is harder
```

#### Path B: Start from Scratch (Minimal Chain)
```
Advantages:
✅ Clean, simple codebase
✅ Only what we need
✅ Easier to understand
✅ Easier to implement RandomX
✅ Faster, lighter nodes

Disadvantages:
❌ Lose 18 sessions of work
❌ Need to rebuild basics
❌ Less battle-tested
❌ Takes longer to production
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Continue with Bitcoin Core fork, but strip down**

**Why:**
- Core components (P2P, blockchain, consensus) are proven
- Dilithium integration is already done
- Can remove unnecessary features (segwit complexity, etc.)
- Change mining algorithm but keep the rest
- Get to launch faster

**Action Items:**
1. Keep: P2P network, blockchain storage, consensus rules, wallet
2. Keep: Our Dilithium integration (Sessions 14-18)
3. Change: Mining algorithm to RandomX
4. Remove: Segwit complexity (not needed for new chain)
5. Remove: Legacy transaction formats
6. Simplify: Script system (we only need Dilithium P2PK)

---

### Decision 3: Genesis Block Parameters

**Must Define NOW:**

```cpp
// Tokenomics
const int64_t TOTAL_SUPPLY = 21000000 * COIN;  // Match Bitcoin
const int64_t INITIAL_BLOCK_REWARD = 50 * COIN;  // Match Bitcoin
const int HALVING_INTERVAL = 210000;  // ~4 years at 10 min blocks

// Genesis Block
const std::string GENESIS_MESSAGE = "Quantum computers threaten ECDSA - Oct 2025";
const uint32_t GENESIS_TIME = 1735689600;  // Jan 1, 2026
const uint32_t GENESIS_NONCE = 0;  // Will be mined

// Network
const int DEFAULT_PORT = 8444;  // Different from Bitcoin
const std::string NETWORK_MAGIC = "d1l1";  // "dili" in hex
const std::string ADDRESS_PREFIX = "dil";  // dil1... addresses
```

**Critical:** Cannot change these after launch!

---

### Decision 4: Simplifications We Can Make

Since this is a NEW chain (not Bitcoin), we can simplify:

#### Remove Complexity

**1. Segwit (Not Needed)**
```
❌ Remove: Witness data, weight units
✅ Keep: Simple transaction format
Result: -50k lines of code
```

**2. Legacy Script Opcodes (Not Needed)**
```
❌ Remove: 100+ opcodes we'll never use
✅ Keep: Just Dilithium signature verification
Result: Simpler, faster script execution
```

**3. Multiple Address Types (Not Needed)**
```
❌ Remove: P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, etc.
✅ Keep: Just Dilithium P2PK
Result: One address type, simpler wallet
```

**4. RBF, CPFP (Can Wait)**
```
❌ Remove: Replace-by-fee, CPFP
✅ Add: Later if needed
Result: Simpler mempool
```

#### Keep Simplicity

**Model: Bitcoin 2009-2010 (before complexity)**
```
✅ Simple transactions
✅ Simple mining
✅ Simple P2P
✅ Simple wallet
✅ Simple node

Add complexity ONLY when needed
```

---

### Decision 5: What to Keep from Sessions 14-18

Our work is NOT wasted! Here's what we keep:

#### ✅ Keep All of This (Core Value)

**Session 14-15: Dilithium Integration**
```
✅ DilithiumKey class
✅ DilithiumPubKey class
✅ DilithiumKeyStore
✅ Signature verification
✅ All crypto tests
```

**Session 16: Address System**
```
✅ Dilithium address format (dil1...)
✅ Bech32m encoding
✅ Address validation
✅ All address RPCs
```

**Session 17: Transaction Building**
```
✅ builddilithiumtransaction RPC
✅ signdilithiumtransactioninput RPC
✅ Transaction serialization
✅ All transaction tests
```

**Session 18: Fee Estimation**
```
✅ estimatedilithiumfee RPC
✅ Size estimation formulas
✅ Fee calculation
✅ All fee tests
```

**Result: 80% of our work is directly reusable!**

#### ⚠️ Modify This (Adapt)

**Mining System:**
```
Current: SHA-256 proof-of-work
New: RandomX proof-of-work
Work: 1-2 weeks to swap
```

**Genesis Block:**
```
Current: Bitcoin genesis
New: Dilithion genesis
Work: 1 day to create
```

**Network Identity:**
```
Current: Bitcoin network magic
New: Dilithion network magic
Work: 1 day to change
```

#### ❌ Remove This (Unnecessary)

**Segwit System:**
```
Remove: Witness commitment, weight calculation
Save: 2 weeks development time going forward
```

**Legacy Features:**
```
Remove: Old transaction formats
Remove: Unused script opcodes
Save: 1 week development time
```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: RandomX Implementation Fails

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Critical (blocks launch)

**Mitigation:**
- Use Monero's proven RandomX library
- Extensive testing on testnet
- Have SHA-256 as fallback (lose narrative but can launch)

### Risk 2: Launch Timing Miss

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (quantum timeline critical)

**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive timeline (10-12 weeks)
- Cut non-essential features
- Parallel workstreams
- Have backup launch date

### Risk 3: Mining Software UX Poor

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical (no miners = failed launch)

**Mitigation:**
- User testing before launch
- Simple, polished UX
- Clear documentation
- Community feedback loop

---

## Recommendation: Pivot Strategy

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Decide on RandomX** (yes/no)
2. **Lock genesis parameters** (supply, reward, etc.)
3. **Start RandomX integration** (if yes to #1)
4. **Update project documentation** (reflect new direction)
5. **Begin mining software design** (parallel track)

### Communication Strategy

**Internal:**
- Sessions 14-18 work is NOT wasted (80% reusable)
- Pivot is strategic, not technical failure
- Timeline is aggressive but achievable
- Focus shifts from "Bitcoin upgrade" to "new chain launch"

**External (when ready):**
- "Dilithion: The Quantum-Safe Bitcoin"
- "Mine from your laptop - second chance at Bitcoin"
- "Launch Q1 2026 - get in early"
- "Fair launch - no pre-mine, no ICO"
