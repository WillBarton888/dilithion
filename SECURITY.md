# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to: **[Your secure email or contact method - please update]**

For critical vulnerabilities, you can also reach us via:
- **GitHub Security Advisory:** https://github.com/WillBarton888/dilithion/security/advisories/new
- **Discord:** [Your Discord handle - to be added]
- **Email:** [Your secure email]

## Response Timeline

We take security seriously and commit to the following response times:

- **Critical vulnerabilities (P0):** Response within 1 hour
- **High severity (P1):** Response within 24 hours
- **Medium severity (P2):** Response within 1 week
- **Low severity (P3):** Best effort

See [INCIDENT-RESPONSE-PLAN.md](INCIDENT-RESPONSE-PLAN.md) for detailed severity definitions.

## Responsible Disclosure

We request **90 days** to patch critical issues before public disclosure.

### Our Commitment:

- We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- We'll provide regular updates on remediation progress
- We'll credit researchers who report responsibly (if desired)
- We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
- We'll pay bug bounties as promised (after mainnet launch)

### Your Commitment:

- Report vulnerabilities privately before public disclosure
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept

## Current Security Status

⚠️ **Experimental Software - Pre-Launch Phase**

- **Code Status:** 100% complete, seeking review
- **Professional audit:** Not yet completed (TBD based on community/budget)
- **Community review:** Actively seeking expert feedback
- **Testing status:** Unit tests complete, testnet launching November 2025
- **Known issues:** See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WillBarton888/dilithion/issues)

### Development Approach

This project was developed with AI assistance (Anthropic's Claude Code). We believe in:
- **Full transparency** about our development methods
- **Community-driven security** through open source review
- **Honest disclosure** of limitations and risks
- **Continuous improvement** based on feedback

**We're actively seeking expert code review in:**
- Post-quantum cryptography implementation
- Blockchain consensus logic
- Network protocol security
- RandomX integration
- Wallet security and key management

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Security

**Post-Quantum Signatures:**
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 (NIST FIPS 204)
- Module-LWE security basis
- Quantum-resistant against Shor's algorithm
- 1,952-byte public keys, 4,032-byte private keys, 3,309-byte signatures

**Quantum-Resistant Hashing:**
- SHA-3/Keccak-256 (NIST FIPS 202)
- Resistant to Grover's algorithm (~128-bit post-quantum security)
- All hashing uses SHA-3 exclusively

**Mining:**
- RandomX proof-of-work (CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant)
- Unaffected by quantum computing speedups

### Wallet Security

**Key Protection:**
- AES-256-CBC encryption for private keys
- PBKDF2-SHA3 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- Random salt and IV generation
- Secure memory wiping for sensitive data

**Best Practices Implemented:**
- Keys never logged or printed
- Private keys encrypted at rest
- User confirmation before transactions
- Change addresses handled securely
- Memory cleared after key operations

### Network Security

**DoS Protection:**
- Connection limits enforced
- Rate limiting on incoming messages
- Memory limits on data structures
- CPU usage bounded
- Maximum message size: 32MB

**Attack Mitigation:**
- Eclipse attack prevention (peer diversity)
- Sybil attack resistance (proof-of-work)
- Peer misbehavior handling (automatic banning)
- Message validation and size limits
