   - Side-channel resistance
   - Memory safety
   - Random number generation

2. **Consensus Rules**

   - Network fork prevention
   - Transaction validation
   - Block acceptance rules

3. **Network Security**
   - DoS resistance
   - Sybil attack prevention
   - Eclipse attack mitigation
   - P2P protocol security

### Future Security Measures

## Cryptographic Security

### CRYSTALS-Dilithium

**Standard:** NIST FIPS 204
**Parameter Set:** Dilithium-2
**Security Level:** NIST Level 2 (128-bit quantum security)

**Known Attacks:**
- Best classical attack: 2^128 operations
- Best quantum attack: 2^128 operations (minimal Grover advantage)

**Side-Channel Resistance:**
- Implementation MUST be constant-time
- No secret-dependent branching
- No secret-dependent memory access
- Proper memory clearing after use

### Hash Functions

**SHA-256:**
- Used for: Mining, Merkle trees
- Quantum security: 128-bit (Grover's algorithm)
- Status: Acceptable for consensus

**BLAKE3:**
- Used for: Address generation
- Quantum security: 128-bit
- Status: Modern, fast, secure

### Random Number Generation

**Critical:** All key generation and signature nonces MUST use cryptographically secure random number generation.

**Sources:**
- `/dev/urandom` (Linux)
- `BCryptGenRandom` (Windows)
- `getentropy()` (OpenBSD/macOS)

**Never use:**
- `rand()` or `random()` (not cryptographically secure)
- Predictable seeds
- Insufficient entropy

---

## Consensus Security

### Critical Invariants

These rules MUST NEVER be violated:

1. **Deterministic Execution**
   - Same input → same output (always)
   - No platform-dependent behavior
   - No undefined behavior
   - No floating-point arithmetic in consensus

2. **Signature Validation**
   - All signatures must be verified
   - Verification must be constant-time
   - Invalid signatures MUST be rejected
   - No signature malleability

3. **Block Validation**
   - Size limits enforced (4MB max)
   - Transaction count limits
   - Weight calculations correct
   - Merkle root verification

4. **Difficulty Adjustment**
   - Follows Bitcoin's algorithm exactly
   - Retargets every 2,016 blocks
   - No manipulation possible
   - Predictable and fair

### Potential Attack Vectors

**51% Attack:**
- Mitigation: SHA-256 PoW (expensive to attack)
- Monitor: Network hash rate
- Response: Community alert if centralization occurs

**Long-Range Attack:**
- Mitigation: Checkpoints (if needed)
- Monitor: Chain reorganization depth
- Response: Alert on deep reorgs

**Sybil Attack:**
- Mitigation: Proof of Work
- Monitor: Node diversity
- Response: Connection limits, peer rotation

**Eclipse Attack:**
- Mitigation: Multiple DNS seeds, peer diversity
- Monitor: Connection patterns
- Response: Manual peer specification option

## Network Security

### DoS Protection

**Message Size Limits:**
- Max protocol message: 8MB
- Max transaction: 100KB
- Max block: 4MB

**Rate Limiting:**
- Connection limits per IP
- Message rate limits
- Ban misbehaving peers

**Resource Limits:**
- Max memory for mempool
- Max CPU for validation
- Disk usage limits

### Privacy Considerations

**Not a Privacy Coin:**
- All transactions are public
- Addresses are pseudonymous (like Bitcoin)
- Network analysis possible

**Privacy Best Practices:**
- Use new address for each transaction
- Avoid address reuse
- Consider using Tor (future support)
