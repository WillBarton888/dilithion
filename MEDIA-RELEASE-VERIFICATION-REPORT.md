## CRITICAL ERRORS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CORRECTION

### ‚ùå ERROR 1: PREMATURE LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT

**Media Release Claims**:
- Dated "January 1, 2026"
- "The Dilithion development team today announced the launch of Dilithion"
- "Launched on January 1, 2026"
- Checkmark (‚úÖ) next to "Mainnet launch (January 1, 2026)"

**Actual Status**:
- Today's date: October 30, 2025
- Project status: TESTNET PHASE (README.md:28 "TESTNET NOW LIVE")
- Mainnet launch: PLANNED for January 1, 2026 (not yet completed)

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Makes false claim that mainnet has launched

**Recommended Fix**:
Option A: Mark as EMBARGO release with clear header:
```
FOR RELEASE ON JANUARY 1, 2026 00:00 UTC
EMBARGO: DO NOT PUBLISH BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2026
```

Option B: Rewrite in future tense:
```
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - October 30, 2025

Dilithion Announces Mainnet Launch Date: January 1, 2026
World's First NIST-Standardized Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency to Go Live
```

### ‚ùå ERROR 2: HALVING SCHEDULE COMPLETELY WRONG

**Media Release Claims**:
- "Halving Schedule: Every 2,100,000 blocks (~16 years)"

**Actual Code** (src/consensus/params.h:30):
```cpp
static const uint32_t SUBSIDY_HALVING_INTERVAL = 210000;
```

**Correct Value**:
- Every 210,000 blocks
- At 4-minute blocks: 210,000 √ó 4 min √∑ 60 √∑ 24 √∑ 365 = ~1.6 years

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Fundamentally misrepresents economic model

**Calculation**:
- 210,000 blocks √ó 4 minutes/block = 840,000 minutes
- 840,000 minutes √∑ 60 = 14,000 hours
- 14,000 hours √∑ 24 = 583.33 days
- 583.33 days √∑ 365 = **1.598 years (~1.6 years)**

**Recommended Fix**: "Halving Schedule: Every 210,000 blocks (~1.6 years)"

---

### ‚ùå ERROR 3: FEE STRUCTURE INCORRECT

**Media Release Claims**:
- MIN_TX_FEE = 100,000 ions (0.001 DIL)
- FEE_PER_BYTE = 38 ions/byte
- MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 50,000 ions (0.0005 DIL)
- Transaction fees: ~0.0025 DIL

**Actual Code** (src/consensus/fees.h:14-20):
```cpp
static const CAmount MIN_TX_FEE = 50000;
static const CAmount FEE_PER_BYTE = 25;
static const CAmount MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 100000;
```

**Correct Values**:
- MIN_TX_FEE = 50,000 ions (0.0005 DIL)
- FEE_PER_BYTE = 25 ions/byte
- MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 100,000 ions (0.001 DIL)

**Fee Calculation for 3,864 byte transaction**:
- Media release: 100,000 + (3,864 √ó 38) = 246,832 ions (0.00246832 DIL)
- **Actual**: 50,000 + (3,864 √ó 25) = **146,600 ions (0.001466 DIL)**

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Overstates transaction fees by 68%

**Recommended Fix**:
- "MIN_TX_FEE = 50,000 ions (0.0005 DIL)"
- "FEE_PER_BYTE = 25 ions/byte"
- "Transaction Fees: ~0.0015 DIL (~$0.0075 USD at $5/DIL)"

---

### ‚ùå ERROR 4: TEST PASS RATE INFLATED

**Media Release Claims**:
- "100% test pass rate (30/30 tests passing)"
- "Grade A Security: Comprehensive security audit with 30/30 tests passing"

**Actual Test Results**:
- run_all_tests.sh: Contains 14 tests (not 30)
- AUDIT-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md:119: "71% test pass rate (100% critical tests)"
- COMPREHENSIVE-BLOCKCHAIN-SECURITY-AUDIT-2025-10-30.md:454: "71% test pass rate (all critical tests passing)"

**Correct Status**:
- ~10/14 tests passing (71% overall)
- 100% critical tests passing
- Grade A security rating

**Impact**: HIGH - Misrepresents testing completeness

**Recommended Fix**:
- "71% test pass rate (100% of critical tests passing)"
- "Grade A Security: Comprehensive security audit with all critical tests passing"

---

### ‚ùå ERROR 5: TPS CAPACITY OVERSTATED

**Media Release Claims**:
- "Network Capacity: ~40-120 TPS (transactions per second)"

**Actual Performance** (multiple audit documents):
- AUDIT-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md:67: "4-42 TPS (vs Bitcoin's 7 TPS)"
- COMPREHENSIVE-BLOCKCHAIN-SECURITY-AUDIT-2025-10-30.md:274-276: "Conservative: 4.2 TPS, Moderate: 20.8 TPS, High: 41.7 TPS"
- DILITHIUM3-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md: "4-42 TPS"

**Correct Value**: 4-42 TPS

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Inflates network capacity by 3x at high end

**Recommended Fix**: "Network Capacity: 4-42 TPS (competitive with Bitcoin's ~7 TPS)"

---

### ‚ùå ERROR 6: MINING POOL SUPPORT MARKED AS COMPLETE

**Media Release Claims**:
- "‚úÖ Mining pool support" (marked as completed)

**Actual Status**:
- No mining pool code found in codebase
- No pool-related files in src/ directory
- Feature not implemented

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Claims non-existent feature

**Recommended Fix**: Either remove from Q1 2026 list or mark as "üîÑ Mining pool support (in development)"

---

### ‚ùå ERROR 7: SIGNATURE VERIFICATION SPEED UNDERSTATED

**Media Release Claims**:
- "Signature Verification: ~500-1,500 signatures per second on modern CPUs"

**Actual Performance** (DILITHIUM3-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md:190):
- "Verifications per second: 1,400 - 1,800 verifications/sec (single-threaded)"

**Correct Value**: 1,400-1,800 verifications/second (single-threaded)

**Impact**: LOW - Understates performance (not overstates)

**Recommended Fix**: "Signature Verification: ~1,400-1,800 signatures per second on modern CPUs (single-threaded)"

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR 8: "FINAL COIN MINED" YEAR NEEDS RECALCULATION

**Media Release Claims**:
- "Final Coin Mined: Year 2090"

**Calculation with Corrected Halving Interval**:
- 64 halvings √ó 210,000 blocks = 13,440,000 blocks total
- 13,440,000 blocks √ó 4 minutes = 53,760,000 minutes
- 53,760,000 min √∑ 60 √∑ 24 √∑ 365 = **102.28 years from genesis**

**Issue**: Depends on actual genesis block timestamp
- If genesis: January 1, 2026
- Final coin: **~2128** (not 2090)

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Off by 38 years

**Recommended Fix**:
- Calculate precisely from genesis timestamp
- OR use approximation: "Final Coin Mined: ~102 years from genesis (~2128)"

## üîç COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE VERIFICATION

### Question: Is Dilithion "the world's first production-ready cryptocurrency built entirely on NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography"?

**Research Findings**:

1. **QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger)**:
   - Original mainnet: June 26, 2018
   - Uses: XMSS (quantum-resistant but NOT NIST FIPS standardized)
   - **Verdict**: NOT using NIST FIPS standards ‚ùå

2. **QRL Project Zond**:
   - Status: In testnet (as of early 2025)
   - Uses: NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA)
   - Mainnet: No date announced
   - **Verdict**: Not launched yet ‚ùå

3. **Arielcoin**:
   - Mainnet: February 2022
   - Uses: CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 (pre-standard version)
   - **Verdict**: NOT using NIST FIPS 204 standardized version (launched before NIST finalized standards in Aug 2024) ‚ùå

4. **BTQ Bitcoin Quantum**:
   - Announced: October 2025
   - Uses: NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)
   - Timeline: Q4 2025 testnet, Q2 2026 mainnet
   - **Verdict**: Planned mainnet in Q2 2026 (April-June) ‚ùå

5. **Dilithion**:
   - Status: Testnet (as of October 30, 2025)
   - Uses: NIST FIPS 204 (Dilithium3) + FIPS 202 (SHA-3)
   - Planned Mainnet: January 1, 2026
   - **Verdict**: IF launched on Jan 1, 2026, would be first ‚úÖ

**CONCLUSION**:
The claim "world's first production-ready cryptocurrency built entirely on NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography" is **POTENTIALLY ACCURATE** with critical qualifications:

‚úÖ **TRUE IF**:
1. Dilithion actually launches on January 1, 2026
2. No other NIST-standardized PQC cryptocurrency launches before that date
3. The claim emphasizes "NIST-standardized" (FIPS 204/202) specifically

‚ùå **CURRENTLY FALSE** because:
1. As of October 30, 2025, mainnet has NOT launched
2. Project is in testnet phase
3. Cannot claim "first" until actually launched

‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK**:
- BTQ Bitcoin Quantum targets Q2 2026 mainnet
- QRL Project Zond could announce earlier mainnet date
- Any delays to January 1 launch could invalidate "first" claim

**RECOMMENDATION**:

For media release dated January 1, 2026:
‚úÖ KEEP the claim if embargo release for actual launch date

For media release dated October 30, 2025:
‚ùå CHANGE to: "Dilithion to become the world's first production-ready cryptocurrency built entirely on NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography when mainnet launches January 1, 2026"

2. **Fix Fee Structure**: Update all fee values to match actual codebase
3. **Fix Test Claims**: Change "30/30 tests" to "71% test pass rate (100% critical tests)"
4. **Fix TPS**: Change "40-120 TPS" to "4-42 TPS"
5. **Fix Launch Status**: Either:
   - Mark as embargo release for Jan 1, 2026, OR
   - Rewrite in future tense as pre-announcement
6. **Remove Mining Pool**: Unless implemented before release
7. **Recalculate Final Coin Year**: ~2128 based on corrected halving

### Documentation Cross-Check:

The following documents ALSO contain fee errors and need correction:
- ‚ùå `HOW-TO-TRANSFER-DIL.md` (lines 216-217, 224, 229)
- ‚úÖ Codebase (src/consensus/fees.h) is CORRECT

### Legal/Compliance:

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Publishing a media release with false launch claims could constitute:
- Securities fraud (if DIL is considered a security)
- False advertising
- Material misrepresentation to investors/users

**Recommendation**: Do NOT publish media release dated "January 1, 2026" until that date actually arrives and mainnet successfully launches.
