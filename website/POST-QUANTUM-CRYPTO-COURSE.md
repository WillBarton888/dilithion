# Module 1: The Quantum Threat

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**What You'll Learn:** Why current cryptocurrencies are vulnerable and when quantum computers will break them

---

## 1.1 What is a Quantum Computer?

### Classical Computers (What We Use Today)

Your laptop, phone, and every computer since the 1940s works with **bits**:
- A bit is either **0** or **1**
- Like a light switch: ON or OFF
- To break encryption, must try many combinations sequentially

### Quantum Computers (The Future)

Quantum computers use **qubits**:
- Can be 0, 1, or **both simultaneously** (superposition)
- Can process many calculations in parallel
- Exponentially faster for certain mathematical problems

**Think of it like this:**
```
Classical computer searching a maze:
- Tries one path at a time
- If wrong, backs up and tries another path
- Takes a LONG time for complex mazes

Quantum computer searching a maze:
- Tries ALL paths simultaneously
- Finds the solution instantly (for certain types of problems)
```

## 1.2 How Quantum Computers Break Current Crypto

### The Algorithm That Changes Everything: Shor's Algorithm (1994)

**Peter Shor** discovered that quantum computers can solve two critical problems efficiently:

1. **Factoring large numbers** (RSA encryption relies on this being hard)
2. **Discrete logarithm problem** (ECDSA signatures rely on this being hard)

### What This Means for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Most Cryptocurrencies

**Current Situation:**
```
Bitcoin Address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
‚îú‚îÄ Public Key: Visible when you spend coins
‚îú‚îÄ Private Key: Secret (controls your money)
‚îî‚îÄ Security: Deriving private key from public key is impossible... today

Classical Computer:
- Would take 2^128 operations (billions of years)
- Your Bitcoin is safe

Quantum Computer with Shor's Algorithm:
- Could derive private key in HOURS or DAYS
- Your Bitcoin could be stolen
```

**Real-world timeline:**
- **2025 (Now):** Quantum computers exist but are too small (~1,000 qubits)
- **2030-2035:** Experts predict "cryptographically relevant" quantum computers (~4,000+ logical qubits)
- **When they arrive:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 95%+ of cryptocurrencies become vulnerable

---

## 1.3 Which Cryptocurrencies Are Vulnerable?

### ‚ùå Vulnerable to Quantum Attacks

**Uses ECDSA or RSA signatures:**
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Ripple (XRP)
- Cardano (ADA)
- Polkadot (DOT)
- Solana (SOL)
- **95%+ of all cryptocurrencies**

**Why?** All use Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which Shor's Algorithm breaks.

### ‚úÖ Quantum-Resistant (Post-Quantum Cryptocurrencies)

**Uses lattice-based or other PQ cryptography:**
- **Dilithion** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 + SHA-3)
- Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) - XMSS signatures
- *Very few others exist*

---

## 1.4 The "Store Now, Decrypt Later" Attack

### Why We Need to Act NOW (Even Before Quantum Computers Exist)

**The Threat:**
```
1. Adversary (government, hacker) records ALL blockchain transactions TODAY
2. Stores encrypted data for 5-10 years
3. When quantum computers arrive in 2030-2035...
4. Decrypts historical data and steals old private keys
5. Empties wallets that were "secure" years ago
```

**This is already happening:**
- NSA and intelligence agencies record encrypted internet traffic
- China announced quantum computing initiatives
- Once quantum computers exist, historical Bitcoin transactions become vulnerable

**Dilithion's solution:**
- Quantum-safe from genesis block (January 1, 2026)
- No historical vulnerability
- Future-proof from day one

## 1.5 Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1:** What makes quantum computers different from classical computers?

a) They're faster at everything
b) They use qubits that can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously
c) They run on quantum energy
d) They're more expensive

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) They use qubits that can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously**

Quantum computers aren't faster at everything - they're exponentially faster at specific mathematical problems like factoring and discrete logarithm. This superposition property is what makes them powerful.
</details>

---

**Question 2:** What algorithm allows quantum computers to break ECDSA signatures?

a) Grover's Algorithm
b) Shor's Algorithm
c) Bitcoin's Algorithm
d) RSA Algorithm

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Shor's Algorithm**

Shor's Algorithm (1994) can efficiently solve the discrete logarithm problem on quantum computers, breaking ECDSA. Grover's Algorithm only provides quadratic speedup (still safe for hashing).
</details>

---

**Question 3:** When do experts predict quantum computers will threaten cryptocurrencies?

a) 2025 (now)
b) 2030-2035
c) 2050+
d) Never

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) 2030-2035**

Most cryptography experts predict cryptographically-relevant quantum computers (4,000+ logical qubits) will exist between 2030-2035. Some estimates are more conservative (2040s), but prudent to prepare now.
</details>

---

**Question 4:** Why should we worry about quantum computers NOW if they don't exist yet?

a) We shouldn't worry
b) "Store now, decrypt later" attacks are already happening
c) Quantum computers are more expensive
d) Bitcoin will automatically upgrade

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) "Store now, decrypt later" attacks are already happening**

Adversaries can record encrypted blockchain data TODAY and decrypt it when quantum computers arrive in 5-10 years. Historical transactions would be compromised. This is why Dilithion launches quantum-safe from genesis.

# Module 2: How Post-Quantum Cryptography Works

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**What You'll Learn:** The mathematics protecting Dilithion from quantum attacks

---

## 2.1 The Two Types of Cryptography in Cryptocurrencies

### 1. Digital Signatures (Proving Ownership)

**What they do:**
- Prove you own your cryptocurrency
- Sign transactions to authorize spending
- Anyone can verify the signature is legitimate

**Classical crypto (ECDSA):**
- Based on elliptic curve math
- ‚ùå Vulnerable to quantum computers

**Post-quantum crypto (Dilithium):**
- Based on lattice math
- ‚úÖ Resistant to quantum computers

---

### 2. Hash Functions (Data Integrity)

**What they do:**
- Create unique "fingerprints" of data
- Used for addresses, block IDs, proof-of-work
- One-way function (can't reverse)

**Classical crypto (SHA-256):**
- Used by Bitcoin
- ‚úÖ Mostly safe from quantum (Grover's algorithm only halves security)

**Post-quantum crypto (SHA-3):**
- Used by Dilithion
- ‚úÖ Same quantum resistance, newer design (NIST FIPS 202)

---

## 2.2 CRYSTALS-Dilithium: The Quantum-Safe Signature Scheme

### What is CRYSTALS-Dilithium?

**Official NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standard**
- Selected by NIST in 2022 after 6-year competition
- Based on **Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE)**
- **FIPS 204** standard (officially approved by US government)
- Three security levels: Dilithium2, **Dilithium3**, Dilithium5

**Dilithion uses Dilithium3:**
- Security Level 3 (equivalent to AES-192 classical security)
- ~128-bit quantum security
- Balanced performance and security

---

### How Lattice Cryptography Works (Simplified)

**Imagine a 3D lattice (grid of points in space):**

```
Classical crypto (ECDSA):
Problem: Find a secret number on a curve
Quantum computer: Can solve easily with Shor's Algorithm

Lattice crypto (Dilithium):
Problem: Find the shortest vector in a high-dimensional lattice
Quantum computer: No efficient algorithm exists (problem remains hard!)
```

**The Security Assumption:**
Finding short vectors in high-dimensional lattices is hard, even for quantum computers.

**Has this been proven?**
- No mathematical proof (same as ECDSA)
- But: 30+ years of research, no quantum algorithm found
- NIST extensively analyzed and standardized it

---

### Key Sizes: The Tradeoff for Quantum Resistance

| Component | ECDSA (Bitcoin) | Dilithium3 (Dilithion) | Ratio |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Public Key | 33 bytes | 1,952 bytes | 59x larger |
| Private Key | 32 bytes | 4,032 bytes | 126x larger |
| Signature | 72 bytes | 3,309 bytes | 46x larger |

**Why so large?**
- Lattice problems require more data (matrices, polynomials)
- ECDSA works with small numbers on elliptic curves
- This is the price of quantum resistance

**Does this matter?**
- Storage: Yes, blockchain grows faster
- Speed: No! Signing/verification is still milliseconds
- Security: Massive improvement (quantum-safe)

---

## 2.3 SHA-3: Quantum-Resistant Hashing

### Why Dilithion Uses SHA-3 Instead of SHA-256

**SHA-256 (Bitcoin):**
- Quantum security: ~128 bits (Grover's algorithm halves it from 256)
- Still secure! But older design (2001)

**SHA-3 (Keccak):**
- Quantum security: ~128 bits (same as SHA-256)
- Newer design (2015), different internal structure
- NIST FIPS 202 standard
- Used in Dilithium library (compatibility)

**Key Point:** Both are quantum-resistant for hashing. SHA-3 is more modern and aligns with post-quantum standards.

---

### What SHA-3 is Used For in Dilithion

1. **Block Hashing**
   - Creates unique ID for each block
   - Links blocks together in chain

2. **Transaction Hashing**
   - Creates transaction IDs (TXIDs)
   - What gets signed by Dilithium signatures

3. **Address Generation**
   - Hash public key ‚Üí Create address
   - Double-hashing for extra security

4. **Proof-of-Work**
   - RandomX internally uses hashing
   - Mining difficulty based on hash values

---

## 2.6 Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1:** What mathematical problem is CRYSTALS-Dilithium based on?

a) Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm
b) RSA Factoring
c) Module Learning With Errors (Lattice problem)
d) SHA-256 Hashing

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**c) Module Learning With Errors (Lattice problem)**

Dilithium's security is based on finding short vectors in high-dimensional lattices, a problem that remains hard even for quantum computers.
</details>

---

**Question 2:** Why are Dilithium signatures so much larger than ECDSA signatures?

a) They're inefficient
b) Lattice problems require more data (matrices/polynomials)
c) It's a mistake in the design
d) Quantum resistance requires redundant data

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Lattice problems require more data (matrices/polynomials)**

This is the fundamental tradeoff. ECDSA works with compact elliptic curve points, while lattice crypto needs larger structures. The security benefit (quantum resistance) is worth the size increase.
</details>

---

**Question 3:** How does SHA-3 compare to SHA-256 against quantum attacks?

a) SHA-3 is quantum-resistant, SHA-256 is not
b) Both provide similar quantum resistance (~128 bits)
c) SHA-256 is better
d) Neither is quantum-resistant

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Both provide similar quantum resistance (~128 bits)**

Grover's algorithm (best quantum attack on hash functions) only provides quadratic speedup, reducing 256-bit security to 128-bit. Both SHA-256 and SHA-3-256 remain secure. SHA-3 is newer and aligns better with post-quantum standards.
</details>

---

**Question 4:** When did NIST officially standardize CRYSTALS-Dilithium?

a) 2015
b) 2018
c) 2022
d) 2025

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**c) 2022**

After a 6-year competition starting in 2016, NIST announced Dilithium as one of four winners in 2022. It was officially published as FIPS 204 standard.

# Module 3: Understanding Blockchain Basics

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**What You'll Learn:** How blockchains work, what makes them secure, and how Dilithion implements them

---

## 3.1 What is a Blockchain?

### The Simple Explanation

**A blockchain is a digital ledger (record book) that:**
- Records all transactions publicly
- Cannot be altered once written (immutable)
- No central authority controls it (decentralized)
- Everyone has a copy and agrees on the contents (consensus)

**Think of it like a public notebook:**
```
Page 1 (Block 1):
‚îú‚îÄ Alice sends 10 coins to Bob
‚îú‚îÄ Charlie sends 5 coins to Dave
‚îî‚îÄ Hash: 0x1a2b3c... (fingerprint of this page)

Page 2 (Block 2):
‚îú‚îÄ References Page 1's hash (0x1a2b3c...)
‚îú‚îÄ Bob sends 5 coins to Eve
‚îú‚îÄ Dave sends 2 coins to Frank
‚îî‚îÄ Hash: 0x4d5e6f... (fingerprint of this page)

Each page references the previous page's hash.
If you change Page 1, the hash changes, breaking the chain.
```

---

## 3.2 Key Components of a Blockchain

### 1. Blocks

**Each block contains:**
```
Block Header:
‚îú‚îÄ Version: Protocol version
‚îú‚îÄ Previous Block Hash: Links to parent block
‚îú‚îÄ Merkle Root: Hash of all transactions
‚îú‚îÄ Timestamp: When block was created
‚îú‚îÄ Difficulty: How hard it was to mine
‚îî‚îÄ Nonce: Random number for mining

Block Body:
‚îî‚îÄ Transactions: List of all transactions in this block
```

**In Dilithion:**
- Block time: 2 minutes (Bitcoin: 10 minutes)
- Max block size: Limited by signature size
- Hash function: SHA-3-256 (quantum-resistant!)

---

### 2. Transactions

**Standard transaction structure:**
```
Transaction:
‚îú‚îÄ Inputs: Where coins come from
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Previous transaction hash
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Output index (which coin)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Signature (proves you own it) ‚Üê Dilithium signature!
‚îú‚îÄ Outputs: Where coins go to
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Amount (how many coins)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Public key hash (recipient's address)
‚îî‚îÄ Fee: Reward for miner
```

**Example:**
```
Alice has 10 DIL (from a previous transaction)
She wants to send 7 DIL to Bob

Transaction:
‚îú‚îÄ Input: Previous TX where Alice received 10 DIL
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Dilithium signature proving Alice owns it
‚îú‚îÄ Output 1: 7 DIL to Bob's address
‚îú‚îÄ Output 2: 2.9995 DIL to Alice (change)
‚îî‚îÄ Fee: 0.0005 DIL to miner
```

---

### 3. UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)

**How Dilithion tracks coin ownership:**

**Not like a bank account:**
```
‚ùå Bank model:
Alice's account: 10 DIL
Bob's account: 5 DIL
(Just a balance in a database)
```

**UTXO model (what Dilithion uses):**
```
‚úÖ UTXO model:
‚îú‚îÄ Output #1: 10 DIL locked to Alice's public key (unspent)
‚îú‚îÄ Output #2: 5 DIL locked to Bob's public key (unspent)
‚îî‚îÄ Output #3: 3 DIL locked to Charlie's public key (spent)

Your "balance" = sum of all unspent outputs locked to your keys
```

**Why UTXO?**
- Better privacy (different addresses per transaction)
- Easier to verify (no account state to track)
- Prevents double-spending
- Bitcoin-style proven model

---

## 3.3 How Transactions Are Verified

### Step-by-Step Transaction Verification

**When a node receives a transaction:**

1. **Check structure**
   - Is transaction properly formatted?
   - Are all required fields present?

2. **Verify inputs exist**
   - Do the referenced outputs exist on the blockchain?
   - Are they unspent (not already spent)?

3. **Verify signatures** ‚Üê **Dilithium signature verification**
   ```cpp
   For each input:
     Extract public key from previous output
     Verify Dilithium signature matches
     If signature invalid ‚Üí reject transaction
   ```

4. **Check amounts**
   - Sum of outputs ‚â§ Sum of inputs?
   - Fee = Inputs - Outputs (must be ‚â• minimum)
   - No negative values?
   - No integer overflow?

5. **Check against consensus rules**
   - Coinbase (mining reward) only in first transaction?
   - Block reward correct for height?
   - Difficulty valid?

**If ALL checks pass ‚Üí Transaction is valid**

---

## 3.4 The Mempool: Waiting Room for Transactions

### What is the Mempool?

**Memory Pool (Mempool):**
- Temporary storage for unconfirmed transactions
- Each node maintains its own mempool
- Miners select transactions from mempool to include in blocks

**Transaction lifecycle:**
```
1. User creates transaction ‚Üí Signs with Dilithium private key
2. Broadcasts to network ‚Üí Sent to connected nodes
3. Enters mempool ‚Üí Waits for miner to pick it up
4. Miner includes in block ‚Üí Transaction gets confirmed
5. Block is mined ‚Üí Transaction is now permanent
```

**Mempool prioritization (how miners choose transactions):**
```
Fee Rate = Transaction Fee / Transaction Size

Higher fee rate ‚Üí Higher priority ‚Üí Faster confirmation

Example:
‚îú‚îÄ Transaction A: 0.001 DIL fee / 5 KB = 0.0002 DIL/KB
‚îî‚îÄ Transaction B: 0.002 DIL fee / 4 KB = 0.0005 DIL/KB ‚Üê Mined first
```

---

## 3.5 Consensus: How the Network Agrees

### The Double-Spend Problem

**Without blockchain:**
```
Alice has 10 DIL

She sends 10 DIL to Bob   ‚îê
At the same time           ‚îú‚îÄ Which is valid?
She sends 10 DIL to Charlie‚îò

Without consensus, both could be accepted (Alice spends 10 DIL twice!)
```

**Blockchain solution:**
```
1. Both transactions broadcast to network
2. Miners see both, include only ONE in a block
3. Whichever gets mined first becomes "truth"
4. The other transaction is rejected (conflicts with confirmed TX)
```

---

### Proof-of-Work: The Consensus Mechanism

**How Dilithion achieves consensus:**

1. **Mining creates blocks**
   - Miners compete to find valid block hash
   - Requires computational work (RandomX)
   - Winner broadcasts block to network

2. **Longest chain rule**
   - Network accepts the chain with most cumulative work
   - If two miners mine simultaneously ‚Üí Temporary fork
   - Eventually one chain becomes longer ‚Üí Network converges

3. **Difficulty adjustment**
   - Target: 1 block every 2 minutes
   - Every 2,016 blocks (~2.8 days), difficulty adjusts
   - Keeps block time consistent despite changing hashrate

---

## 3.6 Network Propagation

### How Blocks Spread Through the Network

**When a block is mined:**
```
Miner A finds block
    ‚Üì Broadcasts to peers
Node B, Node C, Node D receive block
    ‚Üì Validate block
    ‚Üì If valid, broadcast to THEIR peers
Node E, F, G, H, I, J receive block
    ‚Üì Entire network converges

Time to propagate: Usually seconds
```

**What nodes validate:**
- Block hash meets difficulty target
- All transactions are valid (Dilithium signatures check out)
- Block doesn't contain double-spends
- Block size within limits
- Timestamp is reasonable
- Previous block hash exists

**If validation fails ‚Üí Block is rejected**

---

## 3.7 Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1:** What makes a blockchain immutable (unchangeable)?

a) The government protects it
b) Each block references the previous block's hash
c) It's stored on encrypted servers
d) Quantum computers protect it

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Each block references the previous block's hash**

Changing any historical block changes its hash, which breaks the chain (next block points to the OLD hash). To change history, you'd need to remine every subsequent block, which is computationally infeasible.
</details>

---

**Question 2:** What is a UTXO?

a) A type of cryptocurrency
b) An unspent transaction output that can be spent
c) A mining algorithm
d) A quantum-resistant signature

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) An unspent transaction output that can be spent**

UTXO model tracks individual outputs rather than account balances. Your balance is the sum of all UTXOs locked to your public keys.
</details>

---

**Question 3:** What happens when two miners find a block simultaneously?

a) Both blocks are rejected
b) The first one broadcast wins
c) Temporary fork; longest chain eventually wins
d) The network shuts down

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**c) Temporary fork; longest chain eventually wins**

This is normal! The network temporarily has two competing chains. Whichever gets the next block first becomes the "longest chain" and the network converges on that one.
</details>

---

**Question 4:** What determines which transactions get mined first?

a) First come, first served
b) Largest transactions
c) Fee rate (fee per KB)
d) Random selection

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**c) Fee rate (fee per KB)**

Miners are incentivized to maximize fees. They prioritize transactions with highest fee rate (fee divided by transaction size in bytes).

**Dilithion follows Bitcoin's proven model:**
- UTXO transaction model
- Proof-of-Work consensus
- Fixed supply (21 million)
- Halving every 210,000 blocks
- Decentralized network

**Key difference:** Post-quantum cryptography from day one.

## 4.2 Dilithion's Cryptographic Stack

### Complete Technical Specification

| Component | Technology | Quantum-Safe? | Standard |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Signatures** | CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 | ‚úÖ Yes | NIST FIPS 204 |
| **Hashing** | SHA-3 (Keccak-256) | ‚úÖ Yes | NIST FIPS 202 |
| **Mining** | RandomX | ‚ö™ Neutral | Monero (proven) |
| **Key Derivation** | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA3 | ‚úÖ Yes | NIST approved |
| **Address Encoding** | Base58Check | ‚ö™ Neutral | Bitcoin-style |

**Legend:**
- ‚úÖ Quantum-resistant (safe from Shor's/Grover's algorithms)
- ‚ö™ Quantum-neutral (quantum doesn't provide advantage)

---

## 4.3 Block Structure

### Dilithion Block Anatomy

```cpp
Block {
  // Header (80 bytes + 32 bytes SHA-3 hash)
  int32_t version = 1;
  uint256 hashPrevBlock;      // SHA-3 hash of previous block
  uint256 hashMerkleRoot;     // SHA-3 Merkle root of transactions
  uint32_t timestamp;         // Unix timestamp
  uint32_t difficulty;        // Compact difficulty target
  uint64_t nonce;             // RandomX nonce

  // Body (variable size)
  vector<Transaction> vtx;    // All transactions
}
```

**Key differences from Bitcoin:**
- Uses SHA-3 instead of SHA-256
- RandomX nonce (8 bytes) instead of SHA-256 nonce (4 bytes)
- Larger average block size due to Dilithium signatures

---

### Block Size Comparison

**Bitcoin block:**
```
Average transaction size: ~250 bytes (ECDSA signature: 72 bytes)
Transactions per block: ~2,000
Average block size: ~500 KB
```

**Dilithion block:**
```
Average transaction size: ~4,000 bytes (Dilithium signature: 3,309 bytes)
Transactions per block: ~125
Average block size: ~500 KB (similar!)
```

**Despite 46x larger signatures, blocks are similar size because:**
- Fewer transactions per block
- 2-minute block time (vs Bitcoin's 10 min) = more frequent blocks
- Throughput is comparable overall

---

## 4.4 Transaction Structure

### Dilithion Transaction Anatomy

```cpp
Transaction {
  int32_t version = 1;

  // Inputs (spending UTXOs)
  vector<TxIn> vin;
    TxIn {
      uint256 prevout_hash;    // Which previous transaction
      uint32_t prevout_n;      // Which output of that transaction
      vector<uint8_t> signature; // Dilithium signature (3,309 bytes!)
      uint32_t sequence;
    }

  // Outputs (creating new UTXOs)
  vector<TxOut> vout;
    TxOut {
      int64_t value;           // Amount in ions (0.00000001 DIL)
      vector<uint8_t> scriptPubKey; // Locking script (pubkey hash)
    }

  uint32_t locktime;           // When TX can be mined
}
```

**Size breakdown:**
```
ECDSA transaction (Bitcoin):
‚îú‚îÄ Overhead: ~40 bytes
‚îú‚îÄ Input: ~148 bytes (signature: 72 bytes)
‚îú‚îÄ Output: ~34 bytes
‚îî‚îÄ Total: ~250 bytes typical

Dilithium transaction (Dilithion):
‚îú‚îÄ Overhead: ~40 bytes
‚îú‚îÄ Input: ~3,400 bytes (signature: 3,309 bytes!)
‚îú‚îÄ Output: ~34 bytes
‚îî‚îÄ Total: ~3,500 bytes typical
```

**This is the tradeoff for quantum resistance.**

---

## 4.5 Address Generation

### From Private Key to Public Address

**Step-by-step process:**

```
1. Generate Dilithium key pair
   ‚îú‚îÄ Private key: 4,032 bytes (keep secret!)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Public key: 1,952 bytes

2. Hash public key with SHA-3-256
   ‚îî‚îÄ Result: 32 bytes

3. Hash again with SHA-3-256 (double-hash)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Result: 32 bytes

4. Take first 20 bytes
   ‚îî‚îÄ Result: 20-byte public key hash

5. Add version byte (0x1E for mainnet)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Result: 21 bytes

6. Compute checksum (SHA-3 hash, take first 4 bytes)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Append to address

7. Base58 encode
   ‚îî‚îÄ Final address: "D7JS1ujrYsqZrb8p6H5TuSKKbqYPMbwjfV"
```

**Address format:**
```
Mainnet addresses: Start with "D"
Testnet addresses: Start with "T"
```

**Example addresses:**
```
D7JS1ujrYsqZrb8p6H5TuSKKbqYPMbwjfV  ‚Üê Valid mainnet
T7JS1ujrYsqZrb8p6H5TuSKKbqYPMbwjfV  ‚Üê Valid testnet
1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa  ‚Üê Bitcoin (starts with 1)
```

---

## 4.6 Dilithion's Consensus Parameters

### Economic Parameters (Bitcoin-Inspired)

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Total Supply** | 21,000,000 DIL | Proven scarcity model |
| **Initial Reward** | 50 DIL | Same as Bitcoin |
| **Block Time** | 2 minutes | Faster confirmation than BTC |
| **Halving Interval** | 210,000 blocks | ~8 months per halving |
| **Difficulty Adjustment** | Every 2,016 blocks | ~2.8 days |

### Fee Model

**Minimum transaction fee:**
```
Base fee: 0.0005 DIL (fixed)
Size fee: 25 ions per byte (0.00000025 DIL/byte)

Example transaction (3,500 bytes):
‚îú‚îÄ Base: 0.0005 DIL
‚îú‚îÄ Size: 3,500 √ó 0.00000025 = 0.000875 DIL
‚îî‚îÄ Total: 0.001375 DIL (~$0.01 at $10/DIL)
```

**Why higher fees than Bitcoin?**
- Larger transaction sizes (Dilithium signatures)
- Need to incentivize miners despite larger blocks
- Still affordable for everyday use

---

## 4.7 Genesis Block

### The First Block (January 1, 2026 00:00:00 UTC)

```cpp
Genesis Block:
‚îú‚îÄ Timestamp: 1767225600 (Jan 1, 2026 00:00:00 UTC)
‚îú‚îÄ Difficulty: 0x1d00ffff (Bitcoin's genesis difficulty)
‚îú‚îÄ Nonce: [To be determined by mining on Nov 25, 2025]
‚îú‚îÄ Merkle Root: [Computed from coinbase transaction]
‚îî‚îÄ Coinbase message:
    "The Guardian 01/Jan/2026: Quantum computing advances threaten
     cryptocurrency security - Dilithion launches with post-quantum
     protection for The People's Coin"
```

**Significance:**
- Timestamp marks symbolic new year launch
- Coinbase message references quantum threat (like Bitcoin's 2009 bank bailout message)
- Fixed difficulty ensures fair start
- No premine - genesis block mined publicly

---

## 4.8 Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1:** What is Dilithion's block time?

a) 10 minutes (like Bitcoin)
b) 30 seconds
c) 2 minutes
d) 1 minute

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**c) 2 minutes**

Dilithion uses 2-minute blocks (5x faster than Bitcoin's 10 minutes) to balance confirmation speed with network propagation time for larger Dilithium signatures.
</details>

---

**Question 2:** Why are Dilithion transactions larger than Bitcoin transactions?

a) Dilithion is inefficient
b) Dilithium signatures are 46x larger than ECDSA signatures
c) Dilithion includes more metadata
d) It's a bug

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Dilithium signatures are 46x larger than ECDSA signatures**

CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 signatures are ~3,309 bytes vs ECDSA's 72 bytes. This is the fundamental tradeoff for quantum resistance using lattice cryptography.
</details>

---

# Module 5: Mining & Proof-of-Work

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**What You'll Learn:** How RandomX mining works and why it's CPU-friendly

---

## 5.1 What is Mining?

### The Purpose of Mining

**Mining serves three critical functions:**

1. **Secure the network**
   - Makes attacking the blockchain computationally expensive
   - Would-be attacker needs 51% of network hashrate

2. **Reach consensus**
   - Determines which transactions are confirmed
   - Prevents double-spending

3. **Distribute new coins**
   - Fair way to release coins into circulation
   - Incentivizes miners to secure network

---

### How Proof-of-Work Mining Works

**The challenge:**
```
Find a nonce (random number) such that:

SHA-3( Block Header + nonce ) < difficulty_target

Example:
Target:  0000000000ffff....  (lots of leading zeros)
Try #1:  9a3b4c5d6e7f8...  ‚ùå Too high
Try #2:  5f4e3d2c1b0a9...  ‚ùå Too high
Try #3:  00000000001234...  ‚úÖ Success! Block found
```

**Key insight:** There's no shortcut. You must try random nonces until you get lucky.

**Difficulty adjusts to keep block time at ~2 minutes:**
- More miners ‚Üí Increase difficulty
- Fewer miners ‚Üí Decrease difficulty

---

## 5.2 RandomX: CPU-Friendly Mining

### Why Not Use SHA-256 (like Bitcoin)?

**Bitcoin's problem:**
```
2009: CPU mining (everyone can participate)
2010: GPU mining invented (10x faster than CPUs)
2013: ASIC mining invented (1000x faster than GPUs)
2025: Only ASIC manufacturers control Bitcoin mining
```

**Result:** Centralization, expensive hardware, high barrier to entry

**Dilithion's solution: RandomX**
- Designed to be ASIC-resistant
- Optimized for CPU architecture
- Memory-hard (requires 2GB RAM per thread)
- GPUs/ASICs have no significant advantage

---

### How RandomX Works

**RandomX is a Random Code Execution PoW:**

```
1. Generate random program from seed
   ‚îú‚îÄ Seed = Block header
   ‚îî‚îÄ Program = Hundreds of random CPU instructions

2. Execute program in RandomX VM
   ‚îú‚îÄ Integer operations
   ‚îú‚îÄ Floating-point operations
   ‚îú‚îÄ Memory accesses (2GB dataset)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Branch predictions

3. Output = Hash result
   ‚îî‚îÄ Check if hash < difficulty target
```

**Why this works:**
- **Modern CPUs excel at this** - RandomX uses all CPU features
- **ASICs can't specialize** - Program is random each time
- **Memory-hard** - Requires 2GB per thread (expensive for ASICs)
- **GPU inefficient** - Random branching kills GPU parallelism

---

### RandomX Performance

**Expected hash rates (per core):**

| CPU Model | Cores | Hash Rate | Total |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Intel i9-12900K | 16 | ~65 H/s | ~1,040 H/s |
| AMD Ryzen 9 5900X | 12 | ~65 H/s | ~845 H/s |
| Intel i7-12700 | 12 | ~65 H/s | ~780 H/s |
| AMD Ryzen 7 5800X | 8 | ~65 H/s | ~560 H/s |
| Basic laptop (4 cores) | 4 | ~65 H/s | ~260 H/s |

**Key insight:** Even low-end CPUs can mine competitively. A laptop can achieve 25-40% of a high-end desktop's hashrate.

---

## 5.3 Mining Economics

### Block Rewards & Emission Schedule

**Initial reward:** 50 DIL per block
**Halving:** Every 210,000 blocks (~8 months)

| Era | Blocks | Duration | Reward | Coins Mined | % of Supply |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0 - 209,999 | ~8 months | 50 DIL | 10,500,000 | 50% |
| 2 | 210,000 - 419,999 | ~8 months | 25 DIL | 5,250,000 | 25% |
| 3 | 420,000 - 629,999 | ~8 months | 12.5 DIL | 2,625,000 | 12.5% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 21+ | After ~14 years | Forever | 0 DIL | 0 | 0% |

**Total supply:** 21,000,000 DIL (exact, like Bitcoin)

---

### Mining Profitability

**Factors affecting profitability:**

1. **Network hashrate**
   - More miners ‚Üí Lower chance of finding block
   - Your % of network hashrate = Your % of rewards

2. **Electricity cost**
   - RandomX: ~15-20W per core
   - Example: 8-core CPU = ~120-160W
   - At $0.10/kWh: ~$0.012-0.016 per hour

3. **DIL price**
   - Block reward: 50 DIL
   - If DIL = $1: Block worth $50
   - If DIL = $10: Block worth $500

4. **Hardware**
   - CPU mining: Use existing hardware (low investment)
   - No need for expensive ASICs

---

**Example calculation:**

```
Network hashrate: 10,000 H/s
Your hashrate: 500 H/s (8-core CPU)
Your % of network: 5%

Expected blocks per day:
- Network: 720 blocks (1 block/2 min = 720/day)
- Your share: 720 √ó 0.05 = 36 blocks/day

Revenue per day:
- Blocks: 36 √ó 50 DIL = 1,800 DIL/day
- Value at $1/DIL: $1,800/day
- Value at $0.10/DIL: $180/day

Electricity cost:
- 160W √ó 24 hours = 3.84 kWh/day
- At $0.10/kWh: $0.38/day

Profit: $180 - $0.38 = $179.62/day (at $0.10/DIL)
```

**Reality check:** Early days will have low network hashrate (high rewards). As more miners join, profitability decreases (economics).

---

## 5.4 Mining Software

### How to Mine Dilithion

**Option 1: Solo Mining (Built-in)**
```bash
# Start node with mining enabled
./dilithion-node --mine --threads=8

# Your node will:
‚îú‚îÄ Download blockchain
‚îú‚îÄ Validate all blocks
‚îú‚îÄ Mine new blocks with 8 CPU threads
‚îî‚îÄ If you find a block, you get full 50 DIL reward!
```

**Pros:**
- Keep full block reward
- Support decentralization
- No pool fees

**Cons:**
- Irregular income (might find 0 blocks for days, then 3 in a day)
- Need patience

---

**Option 2: Pool Mining (Coming Soon)**
```bash
# Connect to mining pool
./dilithion-miner --pool=pool.dilithion.org --threads=8

# Pool will:
‚îú‚îÄ Coordinate mining with other miners
‚îú‚îÄ Share block rewards proportionally
‚îî‚îÄ Pay you daily based on contributed hashrate
```

**Pros:**
- Regular, predictable income
- Lower variance (steady payouts)

**Cons:**
- Pool fees (typically 1-2%)
- Slight centralization
- Must trust pool operator

---

### Mining Best Practices

**Hardware:**
- ‚úÖ Use modern CPUs (better RandomX performance)
- ‚úÖ Ensure good cooling (mining generates heat)
- ‚úÖ 2GB RAM per thread minimum
- ‚ùå Don't mine on laptops continuously (overheating risk)
- ‚ùå Don't use GPUs (inefficient for RandomX)

**Software:**
- ‚úÖ Keep node updated to latest version
- ‚úÖ Monitor temperature (use tools like HWMonitor)
- ‚úÖ Start with fewer threads, gradually increase
- ‚ùå Don't overclock excessively (instability)

**Economics:**
- ‚úÖ Calculate profitability based on your electricity cost
- ‚úÖ Consider mining as supporting the network (not get-rich-quick)
- ‚úÖ Start small, scale if profitable
- ‚ùå Don't invest more than you can afford to lose

---

## 5.5 Network Security

### 51% Attack

**What is it?**
```
If an attacker controls >50% of network hashrate, they can:
‚îú‚îÄ Double-spend (send coins twice)
‚îú‚îÄ Prevent confirmations
‚îî‚îÄ Reorganize recent blocks

They CANNOT:
‚îú‚îÄ Steal coins from other people's wallets (need private keys)
‚îú‚îÄ Change consensus rules (other nodes would reject)
‚îî‚îÄ Create coins out of thin air (reward limits are enforced)
```

**Why RandomX helps:**
- Anyone with a CPU can mine
- Hard to monopolize hashrate (no ASIC manufacturers)
- Distributed mining = Better security

**Cost of 51% attack:**
```
Assume network hashrate: 100,000 H/s
To control 51%: Need 51,000 H/s
CPUs needed: 51,000 / 65 = ~785 high-end CPUs
Cost: $500/CPU √ó 785 = $392,500

Plus electricity: ~125 kW continuous power

This assumes you can even acquire that many CPUs without raising prices.
Attack is expensive and detectable.
```

## 5.6 Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1:** What is the purpose of mining?

a) Just to create new coins
b) Secure network, reach consensus, distribute coins
c) Heat your room
d) Test your CPU

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Secure network, reach consensus, distribute coins**

Mining serves three functions: (1) Makes attacking the blockchain expensive, (2) Determines which transactions are confirmed, (3) Fairly distributes new coins into circulation.
</details>

---

**Question 2:** Why is RandomX ASIC-resistant?

a) It bans ASICs in the code
b) It uses random CPU instructions and is memory-hard
c) It's encrypted
d) It's quantum-resistant

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) It uses random CPU instructions and is memory-hard**

RandomX generates random programs that utilize all CPU features (integer, floating-point, memory, branches). This makes specialized ASICs inefficient, and the 2GB memory requirement makes them expensive.
</details>

---

**Question 3:** How often does Dilithion's block reward halve?

a) Every year
b) Every 4 years (like Bitcoin)
c) Every 210,000 blocks (~8 months)
d) Never

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**c) Every 210,000 blocks (~8 months)**

Dilithion follows Bitcoin's 210,000 block halving interval, but with 2-minute blocks instead of 10-minute, this happens ~every 8 months instead of 4 years.
</details>

---

**Question 4:** What is a 51% attack?

a) When 51% of users sell their coins
b) When someone controls majority hashrate and can double-spend
c) When 51% of nodes go offline
d) When a quantum computer attacks

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) When someone controls majority hashrate and can double-spend**

With >50% of network hashrate, an attacker can reorganize recent blocks and double-spend coins. However, they still cannot steal others' coins (need private keys) or create coins arbitrarily (consensus rules enforced by nodes).

# Module 6: Wallet Security & Best Practices

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**What You'll Learn:** How to keep your Dilithion safe

---

## 6.1 What is a Wallet?

### Wallet Basics

**A wallet is NOT:**
- ‚ùå A place where coins are stored
- ‚ùå A physical container
- ‚ùå An account on a server

**A wallet IS:**
- ‚úÖ A collection of private keys
- ‚úÖ Software to manage keys and sign transactions
- ‚úÖ An interface to the blockchain

**The coins exist on the blockchain. The wallet just holds the keys.**

```
Blockchain:
‚îú‚îÄ Output 1: 10 DIL locked to Public Key A
‚îú‚îÄ Output 2: 5 DIL locked to Public Key B
‚îî‚îÄ Output 3: 3 DIL locked to Public Key C

Your Wallet:
‚îú‚îÄ Private Key A (controls 10 DIL)
‚îú‚îÄ Private Key B (controls 5 DIL)
‚îî‚îÄ Balance: 15 DIL
```

**If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your coins forever.**
**If someone steals your private keys, they steal your coins forever.**

---

---

## 6.3 Wallet Encryption

### How Dilithion Protects Your Keys

**Unencrypted wallet (DEFAULT IS UNSAFE):**
```
wallet.dat file:
‚îú‚îÄ Private Key 1: [4032 bytes in plaintext]
‚îú‚îÄ Private Key 2: [4032 bytes in plaintext]
‚îî‚îÄ If attacker gets this file ‚Üí Your coins are stolen
```

**Encrypted wallet (ALWAYS DO THIS):**
```
wallet.dat file:
‚îú‚îÄ Encrypted Key 1: [AES-256 encrypted]
‚îú‚îÄ Encrypted Key 2: [AES-256 encrypted]
‚îú‚îÄ Salt: [Random data]
‚îî‚îÄ Encrypted with password ‚Üí Attacker needs password to decrypt
```

---

### Encryption Process

**Step 1: Encrypt your wallet**
```bash
# Via RPC
curl http://localhost:8332 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"encryptwallet","params":["YourStrongPassword123!"],"id":1}'

# Wallet is now encrypted
# Node will restart
```

**Step 2: Unlock for transactions**
```bash
# Unlock for 300 seconds
curl http://localhost:8332 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"walletpassphrase","params":["YourStrongPassword123!", 300],"id":1}'

# Send transaction within 300 seconds
# Wallet auto-locks after timeout
```

---

### Password Best Practices

**Good passwords:**
‚úÖ At least 16 characters
‚úÖ Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
‚úÖ Unique (not used elsewhere)
‚úÖ Random (use password generator)
‚úÖ Example: `K9$mPz2!vQx7@nL5wR3hY`

**Bad passwords:**
‚ùå Short (< 12 characters)
‚ùå Dictionary words
‚ùå Personal info (birthdays, names)
‚ùå Reused from other sites
‚ùå Example: `password123`, `dilithion2026`

**CRITICAL:** If you forget your password, your coins are GONE FOREVER. No recovery possible.

**Backup your password:**
- Write on paper, store in safe
- Use encrypted password manager
- Split into parts (family members each hold part)

---

## 6.4 Backup & Recovery

### The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

**For your wallet:**
- **3** copies (original + 2 backups)
- **2** different media types (USB + cloud OR USB + paper)
- **1** offsite (not in same location)

---

### What to Backup

**Essential:**
1. **Encrypted wallet file** (`wallet.dat`)
2. **Password** (written down, stored safely)

**Optional but recommended:**
3. **Recovery phrase** (if wallet supports BIP39 - future feature)
4. **List of addresses** (to verify backup worked)

---

### Backup Process

**Step 1: Encrypt wallet (if not already encrypted)**

**Step 2: Backup wallet file**
```bash
# Locate wallet file
# Linux: ~/.dilithion/wallet.dat
# Windows: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Dilithion\wallet.dat
# macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Dilithion/wallet.dat

# Copy to USB drive
cp ~/.dilithion/wallet.dat /media/usb/dilithion-backup-2026-01-01.dat

# Copy to encrypted cloud storage
# Use Tresorit, SpiderOak, or encrypt manually with GPG first
```

**Step 3: Test backup**
```bash
# On a TEST computer (not your main one):
1. Install Dilithion node
2. Stop node
3. Replace wallet.dat with backup copy
4. Start node
5. Check balance matches
6. If successful, backup is valid!
```

**Step 4: Secure storage**
```
USB Backup 1: Fireproof safe at home
USB Backup 2: Bank safety deposit box
Password: Paper in separate safe OR encrypted password manager
```

---

## 6.7 Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1:** What does a wallet actually store?

a) Your coins
b) Your private keys
c) Your transaction history
d) Your username and password

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
**b) Your private keys**

Coins exist on the blockchain. The wallet stores private keys that allow you to create signatures proving ownership and spend those coins.
</details>

---

**Question 2:** What happens if you forget your wallet encryption password?

a) You can reset it via email
b) Dilithion support can recover it
c) Your coins are lost forever
d) You can use your recovery phrase

<details>

# Module 7: The Future of Quantum-Safe Crypto

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**What You'll Learn:** Where cryptocurrency is heading in the quantum era

---

## 7.1 The Quantum Computing Timeline

### Current State (2025)

**What exists today:**
- Quantum computers with 100-1,000 qubits (IBM, Google, IonQ)
- Quantum supremacy demonstrated (2019)
- Error rates still high (noisy intermediate-scale quantum - NISQ era)
- Cannot break cryptography yet

**Key limitation:** Need ~4,000 logical qubits to break RSA-2048 or ECDSA-256

---

### Near Future (2030-2035)

**Expert predictions:**
```
Timeline estimates from leading researchers:

Conservative: 2035-2040
‚îú‚îÄ Focus on error correction first
‚îî‚îÄ Slow but steady progress

Moderate: 2030-2035  ‚Üê Most experts agree
‚îú‚îÄ Continued Moore's Law-like growth
‚îî‚îÄ Cryptographically relevant QC likely

Aggressive: 2027-2030
‚îú‚îÄ Major breakthroughs possible
‚îî‚îÄ Some predict faster progress
```

**What this means:**
- Bitcoin/Ethereum vulnerable within 5-10 years
- "Store now, decrypt later" attacks already underway
- Post-quantum migration urgency increasing

---

## 7.2 Migration Challenges for Existing Cryptocurrencies

### Bitcoin's Quantum Dilemma

**The problem:**
```
Bitcoin launched: 2009 (16 years old)
Codebase: Designed for ECDSA
Network: $1+ trillion value at stake
Users: 100+ million people

Migrating to post-quantum crypto requires:
‚îú‚îÄ Hard fork (network-wide upgrade)
‚îú‚îÄ All users update software
‚îú‚îÄ Move coins to new quantum-safe addresses
‚îú‚îÄ Abandon old addresses (or they're vulnerable)
‚îî‚îÄ Coordination nightmare
```

---

### The Migration Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Proactive Migration (Best Case)**
```
2026-2028: Bitcoin devs add PQ signatures (soft fork if possible)
2028-2030: Users voluntarily migrate coins to PQ addresses
2030+: Quantum computers arrive
Result: Bitcoin survives, but painful transition
```

**Scenario 2: Reactive Migration (Medium Case)**
```
2030: Quantum computers exist but not widely accessible
2030-2032: Panic migration as threat becomes real
2032+: Race against quantum attacks
Result: Chaotic but survives if timeline allows
```

**Scenario 3: Too Late (Worst Case)**
```
2028: Unexpected quantum breakthrough
Bitcoin unprepared, no PQ solution ready
Massive theft as old addresses compromised
Result: Bitcoin value collapses
```

---

### Why Dilithion Has an Advantage

**Built quantum-safe from genesis:**
```
‚úÖ No migration needed
‚úÖ No hard fork risks
‚úÖ No legacy vulnerable addresses
‚úÖ Future-proof by design
```

**Analogy:**
```
Bitcoin: Building a house, then retrofitting earthquake protection
Dilithion: Building with earthquake protection from the foundation
```

---

## 7.3 NIST's Influence on Crypto Industry

### The Post-Quantum Standards

**NIST's selected algorithms (2022):**

1. **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** (Signatures) ‚Üê Dilithion uses this
   - Primary recommendation for digital signatures
   - Fastest widespread adoption expected

2. **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (Key Exchange)
   - For encryption (TLS, VPNs)
   - Already being adopted by browsers

3. **SPHINCS+** (Backup Signatures)
   - Stateless hash-based
   - Alternative to lattice schemes

4. **FALCON** (Compact Signatures)
   - Smaller signatures than Dilithium
   - More complex implementation

---

### Industry Adoption Timeline

**Already happening:**
```
2023: Google Chrome tests Kyber for TLS
2024: Apple announces PQ iMessage
2024: Signal adds PQ encryption
2025: Cloudflare deploys PQ by default
```

**What's coming:**
```
2026-2027: Banks migrate to PQ cryptography
2027-2028: Governments mandate PQ for sensitive data
2028-2030: Legacy crypto phase-out begins
2030+: Quantum computers arrive, PQ is standard
```

**Cryptocurrencies are behind:**
- Most still use ECDSA
- Few have concrete PQ plans
- Dilithion is early mover

---

## 7.4 Potential Challenges for Dilithion

‚îú‚îÄ Block size limits
‚îî‚îÄ Optimized P2P protocol
```

**3. Storage requirements**
```
Problem: Full nodes need more disk space
Impact: Higher barrier for running nodes

Mitigation:
‚îú‚îÄ Pruned nodes (store only recent data)
‚îú‚îÄ SPV wallets (don't need full chain)
‚îî‚îÄ Declining storage costs
```

---

### Economic Challenges

**1. Network effect**
```
Bitcoin: 15+ years of adoption, massive ecosystem
Dilithion: New, unproven network

# Glossary of Technical Terms

## A

**Address**
A unique identifier (like D7JS1ujrYsqZrb8p6H5TuSKKbqYPMbwjfV) derived from a public key, used to receive cryptocurrency. Think of it like a bank account number.

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
Symmetric encryption standard used to measure security levels. AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 represent different key sizes.

**Algorithm**
A set of rules or steps for solving a problem. Cryptographic algorithms process data to provide security.

**ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)**
Specialized hardware designed for one purpose (like mining Bitcoin). Much faster than general-purpose CPUs but can't do anything else.

## B

**Base58Check**
Encoding method that converts binary data into human-readable text using 58 characters (excludes confusing characters like 0, O, l, I). Used for cryptocurrency addresses.

**BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)**
Standards for Bitcoin protocol. BIP39 defines mnemonic phrases for wallet recovery.

**Block**
A container of transactions that gets added to the blockchain. Like a page in a ledger book.

**Block Header**
Metadata about a block (timestamp, difficulty, previous block hash, etc.) without the actual transaction data.

**Block Height**
The position of a block in the blockchain. Genesis block is height 0, next is height 1, etc.

**Block Reward**
New coins created and given to miners for successfully mining a block. In Dilithion: starts at 50 DIL, halves every 210,000 blocks.

**Block Time**
Average time between blocks. Bitcoin: 10 minutes, Dilithion: 2 minutes.

**Blockchain**
A chain of blocks linked together by cryptographic hashes. Each block references the previous one, making the chain tamper-proof.

## C

**Coinbase Transaction**
The first transaction in a block, created by the miner, containing the block reward. Not related to Coinbase exchange.

**Cold Storage**
Keeping private keys completely offline (paper wallet, hardware wallet disconnected). Safest for long-term storage.

**Consensus**
Agreement among network participants about the current state of the blockchain. Prevents double-spending.

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
The main processor in a computer. RandomX mining is optimized for CPUs.

**CRYSTALS-Dilithium**
Post-quantum digital signature algorithm standardized by NIST (FIPS 204). Based on lattice cryptography, resistant to quantum attacks.

**CRYSTALS-Kyber**
Post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (for encryption) standardized by NIST. Companion to Dilithium for different cryptographic needs.

**Cryptographic Hash Function**
One-way function that converts input data into a fixed-size output (hash). Cannot be reversed. Examples: SHA-256, SHA-3.

## D

**DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**
Alternative to linear blockchain where multiple blocks can be produced in parallel. Used by some cryptocurrencies, not Dilithion.

**DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**
Cryptocurrency exchange without central authority. Trades happen peer-to-peer.

**Difficulty**
How hard it is to find a valid block hash. Adjusts automatically to keep block time consistent.

**Difficulty Adjustment**
Periodic recalculation of mining difficulty. Dilithion: every 2,016 blocks (~2.8 days).

**Digital Signature**
Cryptographic proof that a message was created by the holder of a specific private key. Like a handwritten signature, but unforgeable.

**Discrete Logarithm Problem**
Mathematical problem underlying ECDSA security. Quantum computers can solve this efficiently (Shor's Algorithm).

**Double-Spend**
Attempting to spend the same coins twice. Blockchain consensus prevents this.

## E

**ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**
Signature scheme used by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most cryptocurrencies. Vulnerable to quantum computers (Shor's Algorithm).

**Encryption**
Converting data into unreadable form without the correct key. Protects confidentiality.

**Entropy**
Randomness. High entropy = unpredictable, secure for cryptographic keys.

## F

**FALCON**
Alternative post-quantum signature scheme (NIST standard). More compact than Dilithium but harder to implement.

**Fee**
Payment to miners for including your transaction in a block. Higher fees = faster confirmation.

**Fee Rate**
Fee per byte of transaction data. Miners prioritize higher fee rates.

**FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard)**
US government standards for cryptography. FIPS 202 = SHA-3, FIPS 204 = Dilithium.

**Fork**
(1) Code divergence (2) Blockchain split into two chains (temporary or permanent).

**Full Node**
A computer running software that validates all blocks and transactions. Stores complete blockchain copy.

## G

**Genesis Block**
