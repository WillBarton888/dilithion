# Dilithion

> A quantum-resistant cryptocurrency built on Bitcoin Core with CRYSTALS-Dilithium post-quantum signatures.

**Status:** Early Development (Phase 0)
**Domain:** [dilithion.com](https://dilithion.com)
**License:** MIT (planned)

## What is Dilithion?

Dilithion is a fair-launch, quantum-resistant cryptocurrency that replaces Bitcoin's ECDSA signatures with CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic signature scheme.

### Why Dilithion?

Quantum computers pose an existential threat to current cryptocurrencies. When large-scale quantum computers become available, they will be able to break the ECDSA signatures that protect Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies.

Dilithion prepares for this future by:
- Using **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** signatures (NIST FIPS 204)
- Maintaining Bitcoin's **proven consensus mechanism**
- Keeping the same **economic model** (21M supply, halving schedule)
- Reusing Bitcoin's **SHA-256 mining** (ASIC compatible)

## Technical Overview

### Core Technology

| Component | Bitcoin | Dilithion |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Signature Scheme** | ECDSA (secp256k1) | CRYSTALS-Dilithium-2 |
| **Public Key Size** | 33 bytes | 1,312 bytes |
| **Signature Size** | ~72 bytes | 2,420 bytes |
| **Address Hash** | RIPEMD160 (20 bytes) | BLAKE3 (32 bytes) |
| **Block Size** | 1 MB | 4 MB |
| **Block Time** | 10 minutes | 10 minutes |
| **Consensus** | Nakamoto PoW | Nakamoto PoW |
| **Mining** | SHA-256 | SHA-256 |
| **Supply** | 21M BTC | 21M DILI |

### Key Features

- **Quantum-Resistant:** Secure against Shor's algorithm and quantum attacks
- **Fair Launch:** No premine, no ICO, no VC backing
- **Bitcoin Compatible:** Same economic model and consensus rules
- **ASIC Friendly:** Reuses SHA-256 mining infrastructure
- **Open Source:** Fully transparent development

## Contributing

**Current Status:** Not accepting external contributions yet.

We're in the early planning and foundation phase. Once we have a working proof-of-concept, we'll open up for community contributions.

**Future Contribution Areas:**
- Core protocol development
- Testing and QA
- Documentation
- Security research
- Code review

---

## Security

### Responsible Disclosure

**NOT YET APPLICABLE** - No code to audit yet.

Once we have working code, we'll establish a security disclosure policy and bug bounty program.

### Audit Status

- **Cryptographer Review:** Planned for Month 13-15
- **Security Audit:** Planned for Month 16-18
- **Academic Paper:** In preparation

## Principles

### Technical Principles

1. **Security First:** Quantum resistance is non-negotiable
2. **Proven Consensus:** Reuse Bitcoin's battle-tested mechanisms
3. **Minimal Changes:** Only modify what's necessary for quantum resistance
4. **Transparency:** Open development from day one

### Community Principles

1. **Fair Launch:** No premine, no insider advantage
2. **No Hype:** Let the technology speak
3. **Long-term Focus:** This is a 5+ year project
4. **Technical Merit:** Build for cryptographers and engineers first

## FAQ

### Why fork Bitcoin instead of starting fresh?

Bitcoin Core has 15+ years of security hardening, proven consensus, and known bugs already fixed. Starting fresh would introduce unnecessary risk.

### Why Dilithium instead of other post-quantum schemes?

CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a NIST standard (FIPS 204), has well-understood security properties, and offers a good balance of signature size and performance.

### Why 4MB blocks?

Dilithium signatures are ~33x larger than ECDSA signatures. To maintain similar transaction throughput to Bitcoin, we need proportionally larger blocks.

### When will this launch?

Planned for Month 25 (approximately 2+ years from start). We won't rush. Security and correctness come first.

### Is this a get-rich-quick scheme?

No. This is a serious technical project to prepare cryptocurrency for the quantum era. It may fail. It will take years. Do not invest what you can't afford to lose.

### What if Bitcoin implements quantum resistance first?

That's fine. We'd consider it a success if this project pushes Bitcoin to upgrade. We're building a testbed and fallback option.
