# Immediate Decisions Needed

**Context:** Project pivot from "Bitcoin upgrade" to "new cryptocurrency"
**Timeline:** Must decide NOW to hit Q1 2026 launch

---

## Decision 1: Confirm Strategic Direction

**Question:** Is this a new cryptocurrency (Dilithion) or Bitcoin upgrade?

**If NEW cryptocurrency:**
✅ Target: Retail public ("second chance Bitcoin")
✅ Mining: Must be CPU-accessible
✅ Timeline: Launch Q1 2026 (before quantum threat)
✅ Marketing: "Digital gold for quantum age"

**If Bitcoin upgrade:**
❌ Wrong codebase (should be BIP/soft fork)
❌ Can't change mining algorithm
❌ Can't change tokenomics
❌ Different strategy entirely

**Decision:** [ ] NEW CRYPTOCURRENCY  or  [ ] BITCOIN UPGRADE

**Impact:** Determines everything else

---

## Decision 2: Mining Algorithm

**Question:** What proof-of-work algorithm?

### Option A: RandomX (CPU-friendly) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Anyone can mine on laptop
- ✅ ASIC-resistant (fair launch)
- ✅ Proven (Monero uses it)
- ✅ Supports "second chance" narrative

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ 2-3 weeks dev time to implement
- ❌ Different from Bitcoin
- ❌ Higher CPU usage

**Decision:** [ ] USE RANDOMX

### Option B: SHA-256 (Current)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Already implemented
- ✅ Simple, proven
- ✅ Zero dev time

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ ASIC-only mining ($10k+ investment)
- ❌ Kills "second chance" narrative
- ❌ Only rich can mine
- ❌ Defeats entire purpose

**Decision:** [ ] KEEP SHA-256

### Recommendation:

**Choose RandomX** - The entire value prop is "regular people can mine again." If you keep SHA-256, only ASIC farms participate and the project narrative fails.

**Cost:** 2-3 weeks development
**Benefit:** Makes or breaks the project

## Decision 3: Genesis Parameters (LOCKED FOREVER)

These cannot change after launch. Decide NOW:

```cpp
// Total Supply
Total coins: 21,000,000 DIL  (match Bitcoin for familiarity)
           [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

// Initial Block Reward
Starting reward: 50 DIL per block  (match Bitcoin)
               [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

// Halving Schedule
Halving every: 210,000 blocks (~4 years at 10 min blocks)
             [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

// Block Time
Target time: 10 minutes per block  (match Bitcoin)
           [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

// Genesis Message
Message: "Quantum computers threaten ECDSA - Oct 2025"
       [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

// Launch Date
Target: January 1, 2026
      [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

// Network
Network magic: "d1l1" (dili)
             [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

Default port: 8444
            [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________

Address prefix: "dil1..."
              [ ] CONFIRMED  or  [ ] CHANGE TO: __________
```

**WARNING:** These are PERMANENT. Choose carefully.

**Recommendation:** Match Bitcoin parameters (21M supply, 50 coin reward, 4 year halvings) because:
- Familiar to crypto users
- Proven tokenomics
- Easy to explain ("Bitcoin but quantum-safe")
- Builds on established mental models

## Decision 4: Development Priority

**Question:** What's the critical path to launch?

### Must Have for Launch (Priority 1)

```
[ ] RandomX mining implementation
[ ] Genesis block creation
[ ] Simple mining software (1-click)
[ ] Desktop wallet (send/receive)
[ ] Block explorer
[ ] Testnet deployment
[ ] Network infrastructure (seed nodes)
```

**Timeline: 10-12 weeks**

### Can Add After Launch (Priority 2-3)

```
[ ] Mobile wallets
[ ] Hardware wallet support
[ ] Exchange integrations
[ ] Lightning network
[ ] Advanced features
```

**Timeline: Ongoing after launch**

**Decision:** [ ] FOCUS ON MUST-HAVES  or  [ ] TRY TO DO EVERYTHING

**Recommendation:** Focus ruthlessly on must-haves. Launch with minimal viable features. Add polish later.

**Why:** Time is critical (quantum threat 3-5 years). Better to launch simple and working than delay for features.

---

## Decision 5: Codebase Strategy

**Question:** Continue with Bitcoin Core fork or start fresh?

### Option A: Continue Bitcoin Core Fork ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Advantages:**
- ✅ 18 sessions of work preserved (80% reusable)
- ✅ Proven P2P, consensus, blockchain code
- ✅ Dilithium integration already done
- ✅ Faster to launch

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Complex codebase (500k lines)
- ❌ Lots of Bitcoin-specific code to remove
- ❌ Harder to customize

**Timeline:** 10-12 weeks to launch

**Decision:** [ ] CONTINUE BITCOIN CORE FORK

### Option B: Start from Scratch

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Clean, minimal code
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ✅ Only what we need

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Lose 18 sessions of work
- ❌ Need to rebuild everything
- ❌ More bugs, less proven

**Timeline:** 20-24 weeks to launch (MISSES quantum timeline)

**Decision:** [ ] START FROM SCRATCH

**Recommendation:** Continue with Bitcoin Core fork but simplify aggressively:
- Keep: P2P, consensus, blockchain, wallet
- Keep: Our Dilithium work (Sessions 14-18)
- Change: Mining algorithm (SHA-256 → RandomX)
- Remove: Segwit complexity
- Remove: Unused features

**Result:** Fast launch with proven code

## Decision 6: Fair Launch Principles

**Question:** How to ensure legitimacy?

### Fair Launch Checklist

```
[ ] NO pre-mine (mine from block 0)
[ ] NO ICO/token sale
[ ] NO VC funding before launch
[ ] NO team allocation
[ ] Pure proof-of-work from genesis
[ ] Open source from day 1
[ ] Public testnet before mainnet
[ ] Clear documentation
[ ] Transparent communication
```

**This is CRITICAL for legitimacy.**

**Any "NO" boxes = project looks like scam**

**Decision:** [ ] COMMIT TO FAIR LAUNCH

**Recommendation:** Follow Bitcoin 2009 model exactly. No shortcuts. This is what makes you different from 99% of altcoins.

---

## Decision 7: Risk Tolerance

**Question:** What if quantum computers are delayed?

### Scenarios

**Scenario A: Quantum in 3-5 years (as assumed)**
- ✅ Perfect timing
- ✅ Urgency validates launch
- ✅ Early miners win big

**Scenario B: Quantum in 8-10 years (delayed)**
- ⚠️ Less urgency
- ⚠️ Harder to market
- ✅ Still works as "digital gold"
- ✅ Still quantum-safe when it matters

**Scenario C: Quantum never practical**
- ❌ Quantum-safety less valuable
- ✅ Still works as new cryptocurrency
- ✅ Fair launch still attracted miners
- ⚠️ Reduced narrative power

**Decision:**
[ ] PROCEED (accept risk)
[ ] WAIT FOR MORE QUANTUM CERTAINTY
[ ] ABANDON PROJECT

**Recommendation:** PROCEED because:
1. Even if quantum delayed, fair-launch mining attracts users
2. "Digital gold" narrative works regardless
3. Being quantum-safe is insurance (better safe than sorry)
4. If quantum arrives as predicted, we're heroes
5. If not, we're still a legitimate cryptocurrency

**The downside is limited (development time). The upside is enormous.**

## Timeline If All Decisions Made NOW

```
Week 1-2:   RandomX integration
Week 3-4:   Genesis block & network setup
Week 5-6:   Mining software development
Week 7-8:   Wallet & infrastructure
Week 9-10:  Testnet deployment & testing
Week 11:    Final prep, marketing materials
Week 12:    MAINNET LAUNCH (Jan 2026)

Then:
2026 Q1:    Community building, first miners
2026 Q2-Q4: Growth, exchange listings
2027:       First halving, FOMO builds
2028:       Quantum threat validates thesis
```

**This is aggressive but achievable**

---

## Recommendation Summary

**If I were making these decisions:**

1. ✅ Confirm: NEW cryptocurrency (not Bitcoin upgrade)
2. ✅ Choose: RandomX mining (CPU-friendly, fair)
3. ✅ Lock: Bitcoin-style parameters (21M supply, 50 reward, 4yr halving)
4. ✅ Focus: Must-haves only for launch
5. ✅ Continue: Bitcoin Core fork (simplified)
6. ✅ Commit: 100% fair launch (no pre-mine)
7. ✅ Accept: Quantum timing risk (upside >> downside)

**Result:**
- Launch-ready in 10-12 weeks
- Fair, accessible mining
- Clear value proposition
- Realistic timeline
- Legitimate project

**Next Steps:**
1. Make these 7 decisions (today)
2. Update project documentation (this week)
3. Start RandomX integration (immediately)
4. Begin mining software (parallel)
5. Lock genesis parameters (no changes after)

## Decision Deadline

**These decisions must be made by:** ASAP (this week)

**Why urgent:**
- 10-12 week development timeline
- Q1 2026 launch target
- Quantum threat timeline
- Community building takes time

**Delaying decisions = Missing window**
