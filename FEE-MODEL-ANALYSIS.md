# Transaction Fee Model Analysis & Recommendations

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** Analysis + Short-term fixes recommended
**Priority:** MEDIUM (acceptable for launch, optimize post-launch)

---

## Executive Summary

Dilithion's transaction fee model is **acceptable for launch** but requires attention for long-term sustainability. The main challenge is balancing:

1. **Large post-quantum signatures** (3,309 bytes each)
2. **Affordable transaction fees** for users
3. **Adequate miner incentives** as block rewards decline
4. **Spam protection** for the network

**Recommendation:** Implement modest short-term adjustments before launch, monitor closely, and plan dynamic fee market for Month 2-3.

---

## Current Fee Model

### Implementation

**File:** `src/consensus/fees.h`

```cpp
static const CAmount MIN_TX_FEE = 10000;        // 10,000 satoshis = 0.0001 DIL
static const CAmount FEE_PER_BYTE = 10;         // 10 sat/byte
static const CAmount MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 50000;  // 50,000 satoshis = 0.0005 DIL
static const CAmount MAX_REASONABLE_FEE = 10000000; // 0.1 DIL

// Formula:
Fee = MIN_TX_FEE + (tx_size_bytes √ó FEE_PER_BYTE)
```

### Transaction Size Estimates

**Dilithium3 Signature Breakdown:**
- **Signature size:** 3,309 bytes
- **Public key size:** 1,952 bytes (in output)
- **Base transaction overhead:** ~42 bytes

**Typical Transaction Sizes:**

| Transaction Type | Size (bytes) | Min Fee (satoshis) | Min Fee (DIL) |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-input, 1-output | 3,864 | 48,640 | 0.00048640 |
| 1-input, 2-output | 5,816 | 68,160 | 0.00068160 |
| 2-input, 1-output | 7,646 | 86,460 | 0.00086460 |
| 2-input, 2-output | 9,598 | 105,980 | 0.00105980 |

**Comparison to Bitcoin:**
- Bitcoin 1-in-1-out: ~250 bytes ‚Üí ~2,500 sats fee
- **Dilithion 1-in-1-out: ~3,864 bytes ‚Üí 48,640 sats fee**
- **Dilithion transactions are ~15x larger and more expensive**

---

## Problem Analysis

### Problem #1: Large Transaction Sizes ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Root Cause:** Post-quantum cryptography signatures are inherently large

**Dilithium3 vs ECDSA:**
| Signature Type | Size | Multiple |
|----------------|------|----------|
| Bitcoin ECDSA | 72 bytes | 1x |
| **Dilithium3** | **3,309 bytes** | **46x larger** |

**Impact:**
- Higher fees per transaction
- Larger blockchain size
- More bandwidth required
- Fewer transactions per block

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ‚úÖ **Already implemented:** 4-minute block time (reduces orphan rate for large blocks)
2. üîÑ **Future:** Signature aggregation research (multi-year project)
3. üîÑ **Future:** Batch verification optimizations

**Verdict:** This is a **fundamental trade-off** of post-quantum security. Accept and optimize around it.

---

### Problem #2: Fee Economics ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current Situation:**

**With 4-minute blocks (360 blocks/day):**

```
Block Reward Schedule:
- Year 1:    50 DIL/block = 18,000 DIL/day
- Year 2:    25 DIL/block = 9,000 DIL/day
- Year 4:    12.5 DIL/block = 4,500 DIL/day
- Year 8:    6.25 DIL/block = 2,250 DIL/day
- Year 16:   3.125 DIL/block = 1,125 DIL/day
```

**Fee-to-Reward Ratio Analysis:**

Assume 10 transactions per block (conservative):
```
Year 1 (50 DIL reward):
- Avg fee per tx: 0.0005 DIL
- 10 tx per block: 0.005 DIL total fees
- Fee/Reward ratio: 0.01% (negligible)

Year 8 (6.25 DIL reward):
- Avg fee per tx: 0.0005 DIL
- 10 tx per block: 0.005 DIL total fees
- Fee/Reward ratio: 0.08% (still very low)

Year 16 (3.125 DIL reward):
- Avg fee per tx: 0.0005 DIL
- 10 tx per block: 0.005 DIL total fees
- Fee/Reward ratio: 0.16% (problematic)

Year 32 (1.5625 DIL reward):
- Avg fee per tx: 0.0005 DIL
- 10 tx per block: 0.005 DIL total fees
- Fee/Reward ratio: 0.32% (critical)
```

**Concern:** As block rewards decline, fees become increasingly important for miner incentives. Current fees are **too low** to sustain mining in the long term (15+ years).

**Counterarguments:**
1. **Price appreciation:** If DIL price increases 10-100x, fees in USD terms become adequate
2. **Transaction volume:** More transactions per block ‚Üí more total fees
3. **Dynamic fees:** Future implementation will allow market-driven pricing

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor closely** - acceptable short-term, needs adjustment long-term

---

### Problem #3: Fixed Fee Model ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current Model:** Fixed base fee + fixed per-byte fee

**Issues:**
1. **No market price discovery** - fees don't reflect demand
2. **Spam vulnerability** - cheap to flood mempool with low-value txs
3. **No congestion pricing** - high-priority txs can't pay more to be included faster
4. **Miner incentive mismatch** - miners can't optimize revenue

**Comparison to Other Chains:**

| Chain | Fee Model | Dynamic? |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Bitcoin | Fixed minimums, market-driven maximums | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Ethereum | EIP-1559 (base fee + priority fee) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Dilithion** | **Fixed base + per-byte** | ‚ùå No |

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs improvement** - implement dynamic fees post-launch

---

## Impact of 4-Minute Block Time

**Previous analysis was based on 2-minute blocks. With our new 4-minute target:**

**Changes:**
- Blocks per day: 720 ‚Üí 360 (50% reduction)
- Daily block rewards: Halved
- Daily fee opportunities: Halved
- **BUT:** More transactions per block (more time to accumulate)

**Net Effect on Fees:**
```
2-minute blocks:
- 720 blocks/day √ó 10 txs/block = 7,200 txs/day
- 7,200 √ó 0.0005 DIL = 3.6 DIL/day in fees

4-minute blocks:
- 360 blocks/day √ó 20 txs/block = 7,200 txs/day (same volume)
- 7,200 √ó 0.0005 DIL = 3.6 DIL/day in fees (same total)
- BUT: 20 txs/block √ó 0.0005 = 0.01 DIL per block (2x per block)
```

**Conclusion:** 4-minute blocks **improve fee economics per block** (miners get 2x more fees per block found), assuming transaction volume remains constant.

## Recommendations

### SHORT-TERM (Before Launch) - RECOMMENDED ‚úÖ

#### Option A: Modest Fee Increase (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale:** Improve spam protection and miner incentives without pricing out users

**Changes:**
```cpp
// src/consensus/fees.h

// Current:
static const CAmount MIN_TX_FEE = 10000;        // 0.0001 DIL
static const CAmount FEE_PER_BYTE = 10;         // 10 sat/byte
static const CAmount MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 50000;  // 0.0005 DIL

// Proposed Option A:
static const CAmount MIN_TX_FEE = 50000;        // 0.0005 DIL (5x increase)
static const CAmount FEE_PER_BYTE = 25;         // 25 sat/byte (2.5x increase)
static const CAmount MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 100000; // 0.001 DIL (2x increase)
```

**New Fee Schedule:**

| Transaction Type | Current Fee | New Fee (Option A) | Change |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1-in, 1-out (3,864b) | 0.00048640 DIL | 0.00146600 DIL | +3.0x |
| 1-in, 2-out (5,816b) | 0.00068160 DIL | 0.00195400 DIL | +2.9x |
| 2-in, 1-out (7,646b) | 0.00086460 DIL | 0.00241150 DIL | +2.8x |
| 2-in, 2-out (9,598b) | 0.00105980 DIL | 0.00289950 DIL | +2.7x |

**Impact Analysis:**
- **User affordability:** Still very cheap (<0.003 DIL per tx)
- **Spam protection:** 3x harder to flood network
- **Miner incentives:** Improved by ~3x
- **Competitive:** Still cheaper than Bitcoin for equivalent security

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Better spam protection
- ‚úÖ Improved miner incentives
- ‚úÖ Still affordable for users
- ‚úÖ Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3x increase might concern some users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still not dynamic (fixed fees)

---

#### Option B: Conservative Increase

**For more conservative approach:**

```cpp
static const CAmount MIN_TX_FEE = 25000;        // 0.00025 DIL (2.5x increase)
static const CAmount FEE_PER_BYTE = 15;         // 15 sat/byte (1.5x increase)
static const CAmount MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 75000;  // 0.00075 DIL (1.5x increase)
```

**New Fees:**
- 1-in-1-out: 0.00082960 DIL (~1.7x increase)
- Less aggressive, still improves economics

---

#### Option C: Keep Current (Not Recommended)

**Rationale:** Wait for market data before adjusting

**Pros:**
- No risk of pricing out early users
- Can adjust based on real usage

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Weaker spam protection
- ‚ùå Lower miner incentives
- ‚ùå Missed opportunity to set better baseline

---

### MEDIUM-TERM (Month 2-3) - PLANNED üîÑ

#### Dynamic Fee Market Implementation

**Goal:** Implement market-driven fee pricing

**Approach 1: Bitcoin-style Priority Queue**

Already partially implemented in mempool:

```cpp
// Mempool prioritizes transactions by fee rate
// Higher fee-rate = faster inclusion
```

**Enhancements needed:**
1. **Fee estimation API**
   - RPC command: `estimatefee <num_blocks>`
   - Returns: Suggested fee rate for confirmation within N blocks

2. **Mempool fee statistics**
   - Track historical fee rates
   - Provide fee market data to wallets

**Estimated work:** 12-16 hours

---

**Approach 2: EIP-1559 Style (Advanced)**

**Mechanism:**
- **Base fee:** Algorithmically adjusted based on block fullness
- **Priority fee:** User-specified tip to miners
- **Fee burn:** Base fee is burned (deflationary)

**Formula:**
```
Total Fee = Base Fee + Priority Fee
Base Fee adjusts: +12.5% if block >50% full, -12.5% if block <50% full
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic fee adjustment
- ‚úÖ Better congestion handling
- ‚úÖ Deflationary pressure (optional)

**Challenges:**
- More complex to implement (40-60 hours)
- Requires thorough testing
- Community education needed

**Recommendation:** Research for Month 6+ deployment

---

### LONG-TERM (Year 2+) - RESEARCH üî¨

#### Signature Aggregation

**Goal:** Reduce transaction sizes through signature aggregation

**Concept:**
```
Current: N inputs = N signatures (N √ó 3,309 bytes)
Future:  N inputs = 1 aggregated signature (~4,000 bytes)
```

**Potential Savings:**
- 2 inputs: 6,618 bytes ‚Üí 4,000 bytes (39% reduction)
- 5 inputs: 16,545 bytes ‚Üí 4,000 bytes (76% reduction)
- 10 inputs: 33,090 bytes ‚Üí 4,000 bytes (88% reduction)

**Status:**
- Academic research ongoing
- Not currently available for Dilithium
- May become available in 2-5 years

**Priority:** LOW (monitor research developments)

---

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (This Week)

**Task:** Implement modest fee increase (Option A)

**Changes:**
```cpp
// src/consensus/fees.h
static const CAmount MIN_TX_FEE = 50000;        // 0.0005 DIL
static const CAmount FEE_PER_BYTE = 25;         // 25 sat/byte
static const CAmount MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 100000; // 0.001 DIL
```

**Effort:** 30 minutes (change constants, rebuild, test)

**Impact:**
- Better spam protection
- Improved miner incentives
- Still very affordable

---

### Phase 2: Post-Launch Month 2 (Monitor & Analyze)

**Tasks:**
1. **Monitor metrics:**
   - Average transactions per block
   - Mempool size and congestion
   - Fee market development
   - Miner profitability

2. **Collect data:**
   - Transaction patterns
   - User feedback on fees
   - Spam attempts (if any)

3. **Analyze:**
   - Are current fees adequate?
   - Is spam protection sufficient?
   - Are miners satisfied?

**Effort:** Ongoing monitoring

---

### Phase 3: Month 3-4 (Dynamic Fees)

**Task:** Implement fee estimation and dynamic pricing

**Deliverables:**
1. `estimatefee` RPC command
2. Mempool fee statistics
3. Wallet fee suggestion improvements
4. Documentation updates

**Effort:** 12-16 hours
**Priority:** HIGH

---

### Phase 4: Year 2+ (Advanced Features)

**Optional enhancements:**
1. EIP-1559 style mechanism (if needed)
2. Signature aggregation (when available)
3. Layer 2 scaling research

**Effort:** Variable
**Priority:** MEDIUM (based on need)

---

## Comparison to Other Post-Quantum Projects

**Note:** Dilithion is pioneering post-quantum cryptocurrency, so there are few direct comparisons.

**Hypothetical Comparison:**

| Aspect | Bitcoin (ECDSA) | Dilithion (Dilithium3) | Ratio |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Signature size | 72 bytes | 3,309 bytes | 46x |
| Typical tx size | ~250 bytes | ~3,864 bytes | 15x |
| Min fee (current) | ~0.00001 BTC | ~0.0005 DIL | 50x higher |
| **Fee per byte** | ~40 sat/byte | ~13 sat/byte | **3x lower** |

**Observation:** Despite larger transactions, Dilithion's per-byte fee is actually **lower** than Bitcoin. This is reasonable given the security trade-off.

---

## Risk Analysis

### Risk #1: Fees Too Low ‚Üí Spam Attacks

**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH (network congestion, poor UX)

**Mitigation:**

---

**Document Created:** October 25, 2025
**Recommendation:** Implement Option A fee increase before launch
**Priority:** MEDIUM (acceptable as-is, but improved with changes)
**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes for Option A implementation

---

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Implement Option A fee increase** (recommended, 30 min)
2. **Keep current fees and monitor** (conservative approach)
3. **Design dynamic fee system first** (more comprehensive, 12-16 hours)

**My recommendation: Implement Option A now** - it's a simple, low-risk improvement that makes the economics more sustainable while keeping fees very affordable for users.
