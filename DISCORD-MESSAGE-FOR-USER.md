## 🚨 URGENT FIX DEPLOYED - Your Issue is Resolved! 🚨

Hey! Thank you so much for being our first tester - you just found **critical bugs** that would have affected everyone!

### What Was Wrong
Your `curl` error happened because the wallet script couldn't find curl even though it was installed. This was a Windows PATH issue that we didn't catch in testing.

**Good news:** We've fixed it along with several other critical issues across ALL platforms!

## ✅ SOLUTION: Download the FIXED Package

**Windows users, download this:**

### What's Fixed:
✅ **curl auto-detection** - Now checks 5 different locations automatically
✅ **Wallet CLI included** - You can now send/receive DIL (was missing before!)

✅ **Works with Git Bash, MSYS2, and Windows native curl**
