# Release Checklist - Dilithion v1.0.0
**Status:** Ready to execute when genesis mining completes

---

## Phase 1: Genesis Block Completion ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

- [x] Fix critical bugs (4 bugs fixed)
- [x] Build test binaries
- [ ] **Complete genesis mining** ‚Üê CURRENT STEP
- [ ] Verify CheckProofOfWork() passes
- [ ] Record nonce and hash

---

## Phase 2: Mainnet Genesis Block

After test mining completes:

### Step 1: Update Genesis Header
```bash
# Edit src/node/genesis.h
# Update: const uint32_t NONCE = [mined_value];
```

### Step 2: Rebuild with Genesis
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion
make clean
make dilithion-node
make genesis_gen
```

### Step 3: Verify Genesis Hash
```bash
./genesis_gen
# Should display valid genesis block with mined nonce
```

### Step 4: Commit Genesis Block
```bash
git add src/node/genesis.h
git commit -m "Add mined genesis block for mainnet launch

Genesis Block:
- Timestamp: 1767225600 (Jan 1, 2026 00:00:00 UTC)
- Nonce: [NONCE_VALUE]
- Hash: [HASH_VALUE]
- Target: 0x1d00ffff

Verified with CheckProofOfWork() - ready for mainnet launch.
