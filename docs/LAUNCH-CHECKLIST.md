## Genesis Block Preparation

### Mining the Genesis Block

**When:** November 25, 2025 (6 weeks before launch)

**Steps:**

1. **Compile Genesis Generator:**
   ```bash
   cd dilithion
   make genesis_gen
   ```

2. **Run Genesis Miner:**
   ```bash
   ./genesis_gen --mine
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Mining genesis block...
   Target: 00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   This may take a while...
   Hashes: 10000
   Hashes: 20000
   ...
   Genesis block found!
   Nonce: 2083236893
   Hash: 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
   ```

3. **Update Genesis Header:**

   Edit `src/node/genesis.h`:
   ```cpp
   const uint32_t NONCE = 2083236893;  // Replace with found nonce
   ```

4. **Verify Genesis Block:**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make genesis_gen
   ./genesis_gen
   ```

   Verify the hash matches!

5. **Commit to Repository:**
   ```bash
   git add src/node/genesis.h
   git commit -m "Add mined genesis block (nonce: 2083236893)"
   git tag v1.0.0-genesis
   git push origin v1.0.0-genesis
   ```

### Genesis Block Verification

**All nodes must have identical genesis:**

- Same timestamp: 1767225600
- Same nonce: [value from mining]
- Same merkle root: [calculated from coinbase]
- Same hash: [resulting hash]

**Critical:** Even one bit difference will cause network split!
