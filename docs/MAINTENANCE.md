## 🎯 Quality Standards to Maintain

### Documentation

**Always:**
- Keep docs in sync with code
- Update examples when APIs change
- Maintain glossary with new terms
- Fix broken links immediately

**Never:**
- Let docs become outdated
- Add undocumented features
- Skip updating changelogs
- Remove docs without reason

### Code

**Always:**
- Write tests for new code
- Follow coding standards
- Document security assumptions
- Review before committing

**Never:**
- Commit without testing
- Skip code review
- Ignore warnings
- Rush commits

### Git Hygiene

**Good Commit Messages:**
```
Add Dilithium signature verification

- Implement CPubKey::Verify() with Dilithium
- Add unit tests for verification
- Validate against NIST test vectors
- Ensure constant-time operations

Closes #42
```

**Bad Commit Messages:**
```
fix
wip
stuff
```

## 🚨 Red Flags - Never Do This

**Security:**
- ❌ Commit private keys or secrets
- ❌ Disable security checks temporarily
- ❌ Skip security reviews
- ❌ Rush cryptographic code

**Code Quality:**
- ❌ Comment out failing tests
- ❌ Skip writing tests
- ❌ Ignore compiler warnings
- ❌ Merge untested code

**Documentation:**
- ❌ Deploy without updating docs
- ❌ Leave TODOs in production docs
- ❌ Break documentation links
- ❌ Remove examples without replacement

**Process:**
- ❌ Merge without review
- ❌ Push directly to main (after you add protections)
- ❌ Ignore CI failures
- ❌ Skip decision checkpoints

## 🔄 Returning After Break

### Coming Back After Days/Weeks/Months?

**Step 1: Sync with repository**
```bash
cd dilithion
git pull origin main
git log --oneline -10  # See recent changes
```

**Step 2: Review status**
```bash
# Read current phase
cat docs/MILESTONES.md | grep "Current Phase"

# Check what's done
cat docs/MILESTONES.md | grep "\[x\]" | tail -5
```

**Step 3: Refresh knowledge**
```bash
# Re-read key docs
cat docs/PROJECT.md
cat docs/MILESTONES.md
cat docs/technical-specification.md | head -100
```

**Step 4: Continue work**
