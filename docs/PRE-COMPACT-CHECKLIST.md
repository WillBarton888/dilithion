## üìã What You Need to Know for Next Session

### Quick Resume Steps

1. **Read the session documentation:**
   ```
   C:\Users\will\dilithion\docs\SESSION-2-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md
   ```

2. **Enter WSL2:**
   ```bash
   wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
   ```

3. **Verify environment:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/crypto-projects/bitcoin-core
   ./src/bitcoind --version
   # Should show: Bitcoin Core version v25.0
   ```

4. **Continue with next steps:**
   - See "Next Session Tasks" in SESSION-2-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md
   - Main task: Resolve git clone issue and add Dilithium library

### Critical Paths

**WSL2 (Linux):**
- Bitcoin Core: `~/crypto-projects/bitcoin-core/`
- Future Dilithion: `~/crypto-projects/dilithion/`

**Windows:**
- Dilithion repo: `C:\Users\will\dilithion\`
- Access from WSL2: `/mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion/`

### Outstanding Issue

**Git Clone Timeout:**
- Issue: Cloning from GitHub to WSL2 times out
- Impact: Cannot clone Dilithion repo inside WSL2
- Workarounds:
  1. Use Windows-side clone: Access via `/mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion`
  2. Fix WSL2 networking (see troubleshooting in SESSION-2)
  3. Use SSH keys instead of HTTPS

**This is not a blocker - multiple solutions available**
