## Performance Expectations

### Hash Rate by CPU

| CPU Model | Cores | Hash Rate | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Intel Core i9-12900K** | 16 | ~1040 H/s | High-end desktop |
| **AMD Ryzen 9 5900X** | 12 | ~845 H/s | High-end desktop |
| **Intel Core i7-12700** | 12 | ~780 H/s | Mid-range desktop |
| **AMD Ryzen 7 5800X** | 8 | ~560 H/s | Mid-range desktop |
| **Intel Core i5-12400** | 6 | ~390 H/s | Budget desktop |
| **AMD Ryzen 5 5600X** | 6 | ~395 H/s | Budget desktop |
| **Intel Core i3-10100** | 4 | ~260 H/s | Entry-level |

**Average:** ~65 H/s per core

### Factors Affecting Hash Rate

1. **CPU Architecture**
   - Newer CPUs: Better RandomX performance
   - AVX2/AVX-512: Significant boost
   - Large L3 Cache: Better performance

2. **RAM Speed**
   - DDR4-3200+: Optimal
   - Dual Channel: +10-15% performance
   - Low latency: Slight improvement

3. **Thermal Throttling**
   - Keep temps under 80°C
   - Better cooling = sustained performance

4. **System Load**
   - Dedicated mining: Best performance
   - Background apps: Reduced hash rate
   - OS overhead: ~5-10% impact

### Expected Block Times

**Network Hash Rate Examples:**

| Network Hash Rate | Your Hash Rate | Avg. Time to Block |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 10 KH/s | 500 H/s | ~40 minutes |
| 100 KH/s | 500 H/s | ~6.7 hours |
| 1 MH/s | 500 H/s | ~2.8 days |
| 10 MH/s | 500 H/s | ~28 days |

**Note:** These are averages. Actual time varies due to randomness.

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Use All CPU Cores

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./dilithion-node --mine --threads=$(nproc)

# Windows (WSL)
./dilithion-node --mine --threads=$(nproc)
```

### 2. Enable Large Pages (Linux)

Large pages improve RandomX performance by ~1-2%.

**Enable:**
```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1250
```

**Permanent (add to /etc/sysctl.conf):**
```
vm.nr_hugepages=1250
```

**Verify:**
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | grep HugePages
```

### 3. CPU Affinity

Pin mining threads to specific cores for better cache utilization.

**Example (Linux):**
```bash
taskset -c 0-7 ./dilithion-node --mine --threads=8
```

### 4. Disable Hyperthreading (Optional)

For some CPUs, disabling SMT/Hyperthreading can improve per-core performance.

**Check if helpful:**
```bash
# Test with HT enabled
./dilithion-node --mine --threads=16

# Test with HT disabled (BIOS setting)
# Reboot and test again
```

### 5. Cooling Optimization

- **Clean dust:** Improves airflow
- **Reapply thermal paste:** Every 1-2 years
- **Improve case airflow:** More fans
- **Undervolt:** Reduce temps without losing performance

### 6. Power Management

**Linux - Disable CPU Frequency Scaling:**
```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

**Verify:**
```bash
cpupower frequency-info
```

### 7. Close Unnecessary Applications

Free up CPU resources:
- Close browsers
- Stop background services
- Disable antivirus scans during mining

## Mining Pools

### Solo vs Pool Mining

**Solo Mining:**
✅ Keep 100% of block rewards
✅ No pool fees
❌ Irregular payouts
❌ Requires patience

**Pool Mining:**
✅ Regular payouts
✅ Predictable income
❌ Pool fees (1-3%)
❌ Centralization risk

### Pool Mining Setup

**Note:** Pool mining requires pool software integration (coming soon).

**When Available:**
1. Choose a pool
2. Get pool address
3. Configure miner
4. Monitor earnings

### Recommended Pools

**Coming Soon:** Pool directory will be published post-launch.

## Profitability

### Calculating Profitability

**Formula:**
```
Daily Revenue = (Your Hash Rate / Network Hash Rate) × Blocks Per Day × Block Reward
```

**Example:**
- Your hash rate: 500 H/s
- Network hash rate: 100 KH/s (100,000 H/s)
- Blocks per day: 720 (144 blocks × 5 days)
- Block reward: 50 DIL

```
Daily DIL = (500 / 100,000) × 720 × 50 = 180 DIL
```

### Costs

**Electricity:**
- CPU Power: ~65-95W per 8-core CPU
- Full System: ~150-250W
- Cost/kWh: Varies by location ($0.05-0.30)

**Example Cost:**
- System power: 200W
- Mining 24/7: 4.8 kWh/day
- Electricity: $0.10/kWh
- **Daily cost: $0.48**

### Break-Even Analysis

Compare daily revenue (in USD) vs. electricity cost:

```
Break-even: Daily DIL Revenue > Daily Electricity Cost
```

**Note:** DIL price will fluctuate. Monitor profitability regularly.

## Troubleshooting

### Low Hash Rate

**Problem:** Getting much lower than expected hash rate

**Solutions:**
1. **Check CPU usage:**
   ```bash
   top
   # Should show 100% CPU usage
   ```

2. **Verify thread count:**
   ```bash
   # Check mining info
   curl http://localhost:8332 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getmininginfo","params":[],"id":1}'
   ```

3. **Check for thermal throttling:**
   ```bash
   # Linux
   sensors
   # Should be under 80°C
   ```

4. **Reduce threads if overheating:**
   ```bash
   ./dilithion-node --mine --threads=6
   ```

### Mining Not Starting

**Problem:** Mining doesn't start when using `--mine` flag

**Solutions:**
1. **Check logs:** Look for error messages at startup
2. **Verify RandomX:** Ensure dependencies are installed
3. **Check memory:** RandomX needs ~2GB RAM per thread
4. **Try fewer threads:**
   ```bash
   ./dilithion-node --mine --threads=2
   ```

### High CPU Temperature

**Problem:** CPU temperature exceeds 85°C

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce thread count:**
   ```bash
   ./dilithion-node --mine --threads=4
   ```

2. **Improve cooling:**
   - Clean CPU cooler
   - Improve case airflow
   - Reapply thermal paste

3. **Undervolt CPU:**
   - Use BIOS or software tools
   - Reduce voltage by 50-100mV

4. **Limit power:**
   ```bash
   # Linux - limit CPU frequency
   sudo cpupower frequency-set -u 3.0GHz
   ```

### System Freezing

**Problem:** System becomes unresponsive during mining

**Solutions:**
1. **Reserve 1-2 cores for system:**
   ```bash
   # Total cores - 2
   ./dilithion-node --mine --threads=6  # If you have 8 cores
   ```

2. **Reduce RAM pressure:**
   - Close other applications
   - Upgrade RAM if possible

3. **Check for overheating:**
   - Monitor temperatures
   - Improve cooling
