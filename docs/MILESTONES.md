## Risk & Decision Checkpoints

### Critical Decision Points

| Month | Question | Go | No-Go |
|-------|----------|----|----|
| 3 | Can you compile modified code? | Continue | Get C++ help |
| 6 | Do unit tests pass for key operations? | Continue | Debug crypto |
| 12 | Does testnet work reliably? | Continue | Fix or abandon |
| 18 | Can you afford security audit? | Continue | Reconsider timeline |
| 23 | Has anyone shown interest? | Continue | Seriously reconsider |
| 30 | Are there 100+ nodes? | Continue | Probably failed |

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- Cryptographic bugs ‚Üí Multiple reviews, extensive testing
- Consensus failures ‚Üí Careful validation, testnet first
- Performance issues ‚Üí Profiling, optimization

**Market Risks:**
- No adoption ‚Üí Long-term view, organic growth
- Bitcoin upgrades first ‚Üí Accept as success
- Quantum threat delayed ‚Üí Educational value remains

**Resource Risks:**
- Funding shortfall ‚Üí Delay audit, bootstrap carefully
- Time constraints ‚Üí Extend timeline, no rushing
- Team limitations ‚Üí Seek collaborators, not employees
