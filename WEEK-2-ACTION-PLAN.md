### Afternoon: Security Communities

**Post to HackerNews (Show HN):**
```
Title: Show HN: Dilithion ‚Äì Experimental Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency

Hi HN,

I built an experimental cryptocurrency using NIST's post-quantum cryptography
standards. It's AI-assisted (Claude Code), and I'm seeking code review.

Why post-quantum? Quantum computers (expected 2030-2035) will break ECDSA
signatures used by Bitcoin/Ethereum. Dilithion uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium3
(NIST FIPS 204), which is quantum-resistant.

Tech stack:
- Dilithium3 signatures (quantum-safe)
- SHA-3 hashing (quantum-resistant)
- RandomX CPU mining (ASIC-resistant)
- C++17, LevelDB, MIT license

Honest disclosure:
- Developed with AI assistance
- Not professionally audited yet
- Experimental (use at own risk)
- Fair launch (no premine/ICO)

Seeking review from:
- Cryptographers (PQC implementation)
- Security researchers (audit)
- Blockchain developers (consensus logic)

GitHub: [link]
Bug bounty: Available

Constructive feedback welcome. This is a learning project exploring
quantum-safe blockchain tech.

- Focus on technical excellence
- Build slowly, organically

**Scenario: Harsh criticism**
- Listen carefully, don't get defensive
- Fix legitimate issues
- Ignore trolls, engage constructively
- Use criticism to improve

**Scenario: Critical security flaw found**
- Thank researcher immediately
- Fix ASAP with Claude's help
- Delay mainnet if needed
- Transparent communication about fix
