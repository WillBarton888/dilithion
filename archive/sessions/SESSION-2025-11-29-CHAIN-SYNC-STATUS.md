# Session Status: Chain Synchronization Investigation

**Date:** 2025-11-29
**Session Type:** Autonomous monitoring and chain sync testing

## Summary

A chain split has been discovered between the local Windows node and the three testnet seed nodes.

## Chain Status

| Node | Height | Best Block Hash |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Local (Windows)** | 171 | `0000c791781f3f82...` |
| NYC (134.122.4.164) | 83 | `0000d7176f72f03b...` |
| Singapore (188.166.255.63) | 83 | `0000d7176f72f03b...` |
| London (209.97.177.197) | 83 | `0000d7176f72f03b...` |

## Analysis

1. **Local chain is longer** (171 > 83) - by 88 blocks
2. **Testnet nodes are in consensus** - all 3 have same best block hash
3. **This indicates the local node was mining in isolation** while testnet nodes may have been reset

## Investigation Steps

1. Find the fork point (common ancestor block)
2. Determine which chain has more cumulative work
3. Document the chain reorg process when they connect

## Current Status

- Local node is running with `--testnet --mine --threads=2`
- Monitoring for P2P connections to testnet nodes
- Watching for chain reorg events

## Next Steps

1. Monitor chain synchronization
2. Test wallet transactions once chains are synced
3. Document any reorg events
