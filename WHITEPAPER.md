## Abstract

Dilithion is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed from the ground up for the post-quantum era. As quantum computers advance toward breaking classical cryptographic systems like ECDSA and RSA, the need for quantum-resistant blockchain technology becomes critical. Dilithion addresses this threat by implementing CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a NIST-standardized post-quantum digital signature scheme, combined with RandomX proof-of-work for ASIC-resistant CPU mining.

This whitepaper presents Dilithion's technical architecture, consensus parameters optimized for large post-quantum signatures, economic model, and roadmap for sustainable decentralized currency in the quantum age.

**Key Features:**
- **Post-quantum security:** CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST FIPS 204)
- **ASIC-resistant mining:** RandomX proof-of-work
- **Optimized consensus:** 4-minute blocks for large signature propagation
- **Fair distribution:** No premine, pure proof-of-work launch
- **Fixed supply:** 21 million coins
- **Launch:** January 1, 2026, 00:00:00 UTC

## 1. Introduction: The Quantum Threat

### 1.1 The Problem

Modern cryptocurrency security relies on classical cryptography:
- **ECDSA (Bitcoin, Ethereum):** Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
- **RSA:** Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption
- **SHA-256:** Secure Hash Algorithm (for mining)

**Shor's Algorithm** (1994) demonstrated that quantum computers can break ECDSA and RSA in polynomial time. While SHA-256 mining receives only a modest speedup (Grover's algorithm), **digital signatures are critically vulnerable**.

### 1.2 Timeline to Quantum Threat

**Current State (2025):**
- IBM: 1,121-qubit quantum computer (Condor)
- Google: Quantum supremacy claimed
- China: Pan-Jianwei's quantum network

**Expert Estimates:**
- **2030-2035:** Cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC)
- **Breaking Bitcoin:** Estimated 1,500-3,000 logical qubits required
- **Current trajectory:** Doubling qubits every ~2 years

**Conclusion:** Cryptocurrencies must transition to post-quantum cryptography **now** to remain secure over their multi-decade lifespan.

### 1.3 Existing Cryptocurrency Vulnerability

| Cryptocurrency | Signature Scheme | Quantum Vulnerable? | Migration Plan? |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Bitcoin | ECDSA | ✅ Yes | None announced |
| Ethereum | ECDSA | ✅ Yes | Research phase only |
| Litecoin | ECDSA | ✅ Yes | None announced |
| Monero | EdDSA | ✅ Yes | None announced |
| **Dilithion** | **Dilithium3** | **❌ No** | **Built-in from genesis** |

**Critical Issue:** Retrofitting existing blockchains with post-quantum cryptography requires:
- Hard fork (community consensus required)
- Wallet migrations (user action required)
- Backward compatibility challenges
- Risk of botched transition

**Dilithion's Solution:** Start with post-quantum cryptography from genesis block.

## 2. Post-Quantum Cryptography

### 2.1 CRYSTALS-Dilithium

**Selection Process:**
- NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization (2016-2024)
- 82 initial submissions
- Multiple rounds of evaluation
- **Winner:** CRYSTALS-Dilithium (2022)
- **Standardized:** FIPS 204 (August 2024)

**Why Dilithium?**

1. **Security:** Based on hard lattice problems (Module-LWE, Module-SIS)
2. **Performance:** Fast signing and verification
3. **Standardization:** Official NIST standard
4. **Analysis:** Years of public cryptanalysis, no serious breaks
5. **Versatility:** Three security levels (Dilithium2, 3, 5)

**Dilithion uses Dilithium3:**
- **Security level:** NIST Level 3 (equivalent to AES-192)
- **Public key size:** 1,952 bytes
- **Signature size:** 3,309 bytes
- **Signing speed:** ~1-2 milliseconds
- **Verification speed:** ~1 millisecond

### 2.2 Comparison to Classical Cryptography

| Metric | ECDSA (secp256k1) | Dilithium3 | Ratio |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Public key** | 33 bytes | 1,952 bytes | 59x larger |
| **Signature** | 72 bytes | 3,309 bytes | 46x larger |
| **Security** | ~128-bit | 192-bit (quantum-safe) | More secure |
| **Signing time** | <1 ms | 1-2 ms | Comparable |
| **Verify time** | ~1 ms | ~1 ms | Identical |
| **Quantum safe?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Critical advantage |

**Trade-off:** Dilithion transactions are ~15x larger than Bitcoin transactions, but provide quantum resistance.

### 2.3 SHA-3 Hashing

Dilithion uses **SHA-3 (Keccak)** throughout:
- **Address generation:** SHA3-256
- **Transaction IDs:** SHA3-256
- **Merkle trees:** SHA3-256
- **Wallet encryption:** SHA3-512 with PBKDF2

**Why SHA-3?**
- Quantum-resistant (Grover's algorithm provides only quadratic speedup)
- NIST standard (FIPS 202)
- Different construction than SHA-2 (defense in depth)
- Well-analyzed and trusted

### 3.2 Transaction Structure

```cpp
class CTransaction {
    int32_t nVersion;               // Transaction version
    std::vector<CTxIn> vin;         // Inputs
    std::vector<CTxOut> vout;       // Outputs
    uint32_t nLockTime;             // Lock time
};

class CTxIn {
    COutPoint prevout;              // Previous output reference
    std::vector<uint8_t> scriptSig; // Dilithium signature (3,309 bytes)
    uint32_t nSequence;             // Sequence number
};

class CTxOut {
    CAmount nValue;                 // Amount in ions (smallest unit)
    std::vector<uint8_t> scriptPubKey; // Dilithium public key (1,952 bytes)
};
```

**Typical Transaction Sizes:**
- 1-input, 1-output: ~3,864 bytes
- 2-input, 2-output: ~9,598 bytes
- Average: ~5,000-7,000 bytes

**Comparison to Bitcoin:**
- Bitcoin typical: ~250 bytes
- **Dilithion is ~15x larger** (trade-off for quantum security)

### 3.3 Currency Units and Denominations

**Base Unit: DIL**
- Symbol: **DIL**
- Total Supply: 21,000,000 DIL
- Decimal Places: 8

**Smallest Unit: ions**
- 1 DIL = 100,000,000 ions
- Named after "Dilith-**ion**" - fitting the post-quantum theme
- Similar to how Bitcoin uses "satoshis" (named after Satoshi Nakamoto)

**Denomination Table:**

| Unit Name | Value in ions | Value in DIL | Description |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **ion** | 1 | 0.00000001 DIL | Smallest unit (indivisible) |
| **kiloion** | 1,000 | 0.00001 DIL | Thousand ions |
| **megaion** | 1,000,000 | 0.01 DIL | Million ions (1 cent) |
| **DIL** | 100,000,000 | 1 DIL | Base currency unit |

**Why "ions"?**
- Consistent with Dilithion branding
- Quantum/scientific theme (from "Dilithium")
- Short, memorable, easy to type
- Avoids confusion with other cryptocurrencies
- Represents the smallest "quantum" of value

**Examples:**
- Minimum transaction fee: 50,000 ions (0.0005 DIL)
- Typical transaction: 100,000-300,000 ions (0.001-0.003 DIL)
- Block reward (initial): 5,000,000,000 ions (50 DIL)

### 3.4 Block Structure

```cpp
class CBlockHeader {
    int32_t nVersion;               // Block version
    uint256 hashPrevBlock;          // Previous block hash (SHA-3)
    uint256 hashMerkleRoot;         // Merkle root of transactions
    uint32_t nTime;                 // Block timestamp
    uint32_t nBits;                 // Difficulty target (compact)
    uint32_t nNonce;                // RandomX nonce
};

class CBlock {
    CBlockHeader header;            // Block header
    std::vector<CTransaction> vtx;  // Transactions
};
```

**Block Properties:**
- **Target time:** 4 minutes (240 seconds)
- **Max size:** 4 MB (soft limit, adjustable)
- **Typical size:** ~500 KB - 2 MB
- **Hash algorithm:** RandomX (for mining)
- **Header hash:** SHA-3-256

---

## 4. Consensus Mechanism

### 4.1 RandomX Proof-of-Work

**Design Goals:**
- ASIC-resistant (keep mining decentralized)
- CPU-optimized (accessible to everyone)
- Memory-hard (prevent brute force)

**RandomX Characteristics:**
- **Memory requirement:** 2 GB (dataset)
- **Algorithm:** Random code execution
- **Hash rate:** ~60-80 H/s per CPU core (consumer hardware)
- **ASIC resistance:** High (designed to utilize general-purpose CPU features)

**Why RandomX?**
1. **Proven:** Used by Monero since 2019
2. **Fair:** Anyone with a CPU can mine
3. **Decentralized:** Prevents mining centralization
4. **Secure:** Well-analyzed, no shortcuts found

### 4.2 Block Time: 4 Minutes

**Decision Rationale:**

Original proposal: 2 minutes (5x faster than Bitcoin)
**Final decision: 4 minutes** (2.5x faster than Bitcoin)

**Why 4 minutes is optimal:**

1. **Large Signature Propagation**
   - Dilithium signatures: 3,309 bytes each
   - Typical block: 10-50 transactions = 33-165 KB of signatures
   - Global network needs time to propagate
   - **4 minutes reduces orphan rate by ~50%** vs 2-minute blocks

2. **Blockchain Growth**
   ```
   2-minute blocks: 720 blocks/day = ~767 GB/year
   4-minute blocks: 360 blocks/day = ~365 GB/year (50% reduction)
   ```

3. **Balanced Confirmation Time**
   ```
   Bitcoin:    10 min/block × 6 confirmations = 60 minutes
   Dilithion:   4 min/block × 3 confirmations = 12 minutes (5x faster)
   Litecoin:  2.5 min/block × 6 confirmations = 15 minutes
   ```

4. **Better Emission Schedule**
   ```
   2-min: 62.6% mined in Year 1 (too aggressive)
   4-min: 31.3% mined in Year 1 (balanced distribution)
   ```

5. **Global Mining Fairness**
   - Network latency (200-400ms globally) becomes smaller % of block time
   - Miners worldwide have equal opportunity

### 4.3 Difficulty Adjustment

**Algorithm:** Similar to Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment

```cpp
// Adjust difficulty every 2016 blocks
const int64_t DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL = 2016;
const int64_t BLOCK_TARGET_SPACING = 240; // 4 minutes

// Target timespan: 2016 blocks × 4 minutes = 5.6 days
const int64_t TARGET_TIMESPAN = DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL * BLOCK_TARGET_SPACING;

// Difficulty adjustment formula:
new_difficulty = old_difficulty * (actual_time / target_time)

// With bounds:
new_difficulty = clamp(new_difficulty, old_difficulty / 4, old_difficulty * 4)
```

**Properties:**
- Adjusts every ~5.6 days
- Maximum change: 4x per adjustment
- Prevents difficulty manipulation attacks
- Responsive to hash rate changes

### 4.4 Timestamp Validation

**Rules:**
1. Block time must not be more than **2 hours in the future**
2. Block time must be greater than **median-time-past** (last 11 blocks)

**Prevents:**
- Time manipulation attacks
- Difficulty adjustment gaming
- Chain reorganization exploits

## 5. Economic Model

### 5.1 Supply Schedule

```
Total Supply:    21,000,000 DIL (fixed cap)
Initial Reward:  50 DIL per block
Block Time:      4 minutes (240 seconds)
Halving:         Every 210,000 blocks (~1.6 years)
```

### 5.2 Emission Schedule

| Halving | Block Range | Reward | Duration | DIL Mined | % of Supply | Cumulative % |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 0 | 0 - 209,999 | 50 DIL | 1.60 years | 10,500,000 | 50.0% | 50.0% |
| 1 | 210k - 419,999 | 25 DIL | 1.60 years | 5,250,000 | 25.0% | 75.0% |
| 2 | 420k - 629,999 | 12.5 DIL | 1.60 years | 2,625,000 | 12.5% | 87.5% |
| 3 | 630k - 839,999 | 6.25 DIL | 1.60 years | 1,312,500 | 6.25% | 93.75% |
| 4+ | 840k+ | <6.25 DIL | ~8 years | ~1,312,500 | ~6.25% | ~100% |

**Year-by-Year Emission:**
- **Year 1:** 6,570,000 DIL (31.3% of total supply)
- **Year 2:** 5,250,000 DIL (25.0%)
- **Year 3:** 3,285,000 DIL (15.6%)
- **Year 5:** 89.1% mined
- **Year 13:** 99%+ mined

### 5.3 Comparison to Bitcoin

| Metric | Bitcoin | Dilithion | Ratio |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 21M BTC | 21M DIL | 1:1 |
| **Initial Reward** | 50 BTC | 50 DIL | 1:1 |
| **Block Time** | 10 min | 4 min | 2.5x faster |
| **Halving Period** | 210,000 blocks | 210,000 blocks | 1:1 |
| **First Halving** | ~4 years | ~1.6 years | 2.5x faster |
| **99% Mined** | ~32 years | ~12.8 years | 2.5x faster |
| **Year 1 Emission** | 12.5% | 31.3% | 2.5x faster |

**Conclusion:** Dilithion's emission is **exactly 2.5x faster** than Bitcoin (matching the block time ratio).

### 5.4 Transaction Fees

**Fee Model (Option A):**

```cpp
// Consensus parameters
MIN_TX_FEE = 50,000 ions          // 0.0005 DIL (base fee)
FEE_PER_BYTE = 25 ions            // 25 ions per byte
MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 100,000 ions   // 0.001 DIL (relay minimum)

// Fee calculation
fee = MIN_TX_FEE + (transaction_size_bytes × FEE_PER_BYTE)
```

**Typical Transaction Fees:**
| Transaction Type | Size | Fee (DIL) | Fee (USD at $1/DIL) |
|------------------|------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1-in, 1-out | 3,864 bytes | 0.00147 | $0.00147 |
| 1-in, 2-out | 5,816 bytes | 0.00195 | $0.00195 |
| 2-in, 2-out | 9,598 bytes | 0.00290 | $0.00290 |

**Design Goals:**
1. **Affordable:** Fees remain negligible (<$0.003 per transaction)
2. **Spam protection:** 3x higher than minimal baseline (prevents cheap attacks)
3. **Miner incentives:** Provides meaningful revenue (3x improvement over original)
4. **Sustainable:** Scales with transaction complexity

**Long-term Fee Market:**
- **Short-term:** Fixed fee model (simple, predictable)
- **Year 1-2:** Monitor usage patterns and fee adequacy
- **Year 2+:** Implement dynamic fee market (EIP-1559 style consideration)

### 5.5 Inflation Rate

| Year | Supply Start | Annual Emission | Supply End | Inflation Rate |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | 0 | 6,570,000 | 6,570,000 | N/A |
| 2 | 6,570,000 | 5,250,000 | 11,820,000 | 79.9% |
| 3 | 11,820,000 | 3,285,000 | 15,105,000 | 27.8% |
| 4 | 15,105,000 | 1,965,000 | 17,070,000 | 13.0% |
| 5 | 17,070,000 | 1,642,500 | 18,712,500 | 9.6% |
| 10 | ~20,200,000 | ~205,000 | ~20,405,000 | ~1.0% |
| 20 | ~20,900,000 | ~12,800 | ~20,912,800 | ~0.06% |

**Observation:** Inflation drops to single digits by Year 5, below 1% by Year 10.

## 6. Network Security

### 6.1 Attack Vector Analysis

#### 6.1.1 51% Attack

**Definition:** Attacker controls >50% of network hash rate

**Dilithion Defenses:**
1. **RandomX CPU Mining**
   - No ASICs available (ASIC-resistant design)
   - Attacker must acquire thousands of consumer CPUs
   - Very expensive and detectable

2. **Confirmation Requirements**
   ```
   Small tx (<$100):    3 confirmations = 12 minutes
   Medium tx ($1K):     6 confirmations = 24 minutes
   Large tx ($10K+):    10 confirmations = 40 minutes
   Exchange deposits:   20+ confirmations = 80+ minutes
   ```

3. **Economic Disincentive**
   ```
   Attack cost: $20,000-$50,000 (hardware)
   Attack profit: $1,000-$5,000 (one-time, if successful)
   Consequence: Coin price crashes, attacker's holdings worthless
   Result: Attacker loses money
   ```

**Risk Level:** LOW to MEDIUM (economically impractical)

#### 6.1.2 Double-Spend Attack

**Mitigation:**
- Requires 51% attack to succeed
- Exchanges wait for multiple confirmations
- Cost exceeds potential gain

**Risk Level:** LOW (same as 51% attack)

#### 6.1.3 Sybil Attack

**Definition:** Attacker creates many fake network nodes

**Dilithion Defenses:**
1. Mining power matters, not node count
2. Nodes don't receive rewards (no incentive to fake)
3. Peer quality scoring (future enhancement)

**Risk Level:** LOW (ineffective attack vector)

#### 6.1.4 Eclipse Attack

**Definition:** Isolate a node from the honest network

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple seed nodes (DNS + hardcoded)
- Peer diversity requirements
- Automatic peer discovery

**Risk Level:** LOW (standard Bitcoin-style defenses)

#### 6.1.5 Quantum Computer Attack

**Definition:** Use quantum computer to break cryptography

**Dilithion Defense:**
- **Signatures:** Quantum-resistant (Dilithium3)
- **Hashing:** Quantum-resistant (SHA-3, only Grover speedup)
- **Mining:** Quantum computers provide minimal advantage (Grover = 2x speedup at best)

**Verdict:** ✅ **Dilithion is quantum-safe** (primary design goal)

### 6.2 Wallet Security

**Features:**
1. **AES-256-CBC Encryption**
   - Industry-standard wallet encryption
