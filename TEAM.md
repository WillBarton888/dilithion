## Development Approach

This project was developed using AI assistance (Anthropic's Claude Code):

### What This Means:
- **Architecture designed** with AI guidance
- **Code generated and reviewed** with AI
- **Security best practices** implemented with AI assistance
- **Human oversight and decision-making** throughout the process
- **Educational focus:** Learning blockchain development through AI collaboration

### Why Disclose This?

**Transparency and honesty are core values.** AI-assisted development is innovative but comes with unique challenges. We believe in being upfront about our methods rather than hiding them.

**This approach has benefits:**
-  Access to best practices and modern coding standards
-  Comprehensive documentation and educational resources
-  Consistent code quality and architecture
-  Rapid prototyping and iteration

**And challenges we acknowledge:**
-   AI-generated code requires careful human review
-   No substitute for expert cryptographer validation
-   Community code review even more critical
-   Experimental nature must be honestly communicated

## FAQ About Our Development Approach

### Q: Is AI-generated code safe?

**A:** AI-generated code requires the same scrutiny as human-written code. We're seeking extensive code review from cryptographers, security researchers, and blockchain developers. The code is open source for full transparency.

### Q: Who is ultimately responsible for the code?

**A:** Will Barton (project lead) takes full responsibility for all code, decisions, and the project's direction. AI is a tool; human judgment and accountability remain essential.

### Q: Why use AI instead of hiring developers?

**A:** This is a learning project with educational goals. AI assistance enables rapid development while learning, but we're actively seeking expert contributors and reviewers.

### Q: Will AI be used for future development?

**A:** AI will continue to be a development tool, but all changes will undergo human review, testing, and community feedback before deployment.

### Q: How can I trust this project?

**A:**
1. Full source code transparency (MIT License)
2. Comprehensive security review process
3. Honest disclosure of methods and limitations
4. Active community code review
5. Bug bounty program
6. Testnet before mainnet

Trust is earned, not given. We're committed to earning it through transparency and responsible development.
