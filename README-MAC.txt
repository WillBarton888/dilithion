  DILITHION - POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOCURRENCY
  TESTNET RELEASE v1.0.0 - macOS
================================================================

Welcome to Dilithion!

This is the TESTNET version. Testnet coins have NO monetary value.
They are for testing only.

================================================================
  WHAT IS DILITHION?
================================================================

Dilithion is a post-quantum cryptocurrency that uses NIST-
standardized cryptography (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, SHA-3) to protect
against future quantum computer attacks.

This testnet allows you to:
  - Test mining Dilithion coins (testnet DIL)
  - Experiment with the wallet
  - Help us find bugs before mainnet launch

================================================================
  GETTING STARTED - THREE EASY WAYS
================================================================

OPTION 1: ONE-CLICK MINING (Easiest!)
---------------------------------------
1. Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
2. Navigate to this folder:
   cd ~/Downloads/dilithion-testnet-macos
   (or wherever you extracted the files)
3. Run: ./start-mining.sh
4. You're mining!

That's it! The script automatically:
  - Connects to the official seed node
  - Detects your CPU cores
  - Starts mining testnet DIL


OPTION 2: INTERACTIVE SETUP WIZARD
---------------------------------------
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: ./setup-and-start.sh
4. Follow the on-screen instructions
5. Choose how many CPU cores to use
6. Start mining!

This wizard walks you through each step and explains
what each setting does.


OPTION 3: ADVANCED (Command Line)
---------------------------------------
Run with no arguments for auto-start:
  ./dilithion-node

Or customize with arguments:
  ./dilithion-node --testnet --mine --threads=4

For all options:
  ./dilithion-node --help

================================================================
  FIRST TIME SETUP - IMPORTANT FOR macOS
================================================================

macOS SECURITY WARNING:

When you first run the binaries, macOS Gatekeeper may block
them because they're not from the App Store or a verified
developer.

TO FIX THIS:

Method 1 (Easiest):
1. Right-click the file (dilithion-node)
2. Select "Open"
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog
4. Repeat for each binary that gets blocked

Method 2 (Command Line):
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine dilithion-node
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine check-wallet-balance
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine start-mining.sh
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine setup-and-start.sh

Method 3 (Allow in System Preferences):
1. Try to run the binary
2. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy
3. Click "Allow Anyway" for the blocked app
4. Try running again

PERMISSIONS:

Make scripts executable if needed:
  chmod +x dilithion-node
  chmod +x check-wallet-balance
  chmod +x start-mining.sh
  chmod +x setup-and-start.sh

================================================================
  HOW TO STOP MINING
================================================================

Press Ctrl+C (or Command+C) in the Terminal where the miner
is running.

The node will shut down gracefully.

================================================================
  WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN MINING
================================================================

When you start mining, you'll see:

1. CONNECTION MESSAGES
   - "Connected to peer: 170.64.203.134:18444"
   - This means you've connected to the official seed node

2. BLOCKCHAIN SYNC
   - "Downloading blocks..."
   - Your node catches up to the latest block

3. MINING MESSAGES
   - "Mining block at height XXXXX..."
   - "Block found! Hash: 00000..."
   - Your CPU is trying to find new blocks

4. NETWORK ACTIVITY
   - Messages about peers connecting/disconnecting
   - New transactions received
   - New blocks discovered by other miners

================================================================
  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================

Q: How long until I mine a block?
A: Testnet difficulty is LOW (256x easier than mainnet).
   Depending on your CPU and network hashrate, you might find
   blocks in minutes to hours. Mainnet will be much harder!

Q: Do testnet coins have value?
A: NO! Testnet DIL has zero monetary value. They are for
   testing only. The mainnet will launch later with real coins.

Q: How do I check my balance?
A: Run: ./check-wallet-balance
   This shows your testnet DIL balance.

Q: Is this safe?
A: Testnet mining is safe. It only uses CPU (no GPU needed)
   and won't harm your Mac. You can stop it anytime with Ctrl+C.

Q: Will this work on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?
A: This binary is compiled for x86_64 (Intel). It will run on
   Apple Silicon Macs through Rosetta 2 translation, but may be
   slower. We're working on native ARM64 binaries for Apple
   Silicon.

Q: Can I mine on a MacBook?
A: Yes, but MacBooks may get warm. Use the wizard to choose
   1-2 cores for light mining. Mac desktops (iMac, Mac Studio)
   handle mining better.

Q: What's the official seed node?
A: 170.64.203.134:18444
   All launcher scripts connect to this automatically.

================================================================
  RUNNING IN BACKGROUND (OPTIONAL)
================================================================

To keep mining when you close Terminal:

1. Install screen or tmux (using Homebrew):
   brew install screen

2. Start a screen session:
   screen -S dilithion

3. Run the miner:
   ./start-mining.sh

4. Detach with: Ctrl+A, then D

5. Reattach anytime with:
   screen -r dilithion

Alternatively, use nohup:
  nohup ./dilithion-node --testnet --mine &

================================================================
  SECURITY NOTE
================================================================

IMPORTANT: This is TESTNET software. Do NOT use testnet wallets
or addresses for real value. When mainnet launches, you'll need
to create a new wallet.

The testnet uses different network ports and a different genesis
block than mainnet. They are completely separate networks.

================================================================
  WHAT'S NEXT?
================================================================

1. Bypass macOS security (see "FIRST TIME SETUP" above)
2. Start mining with ./start-mining.sh
3. Let it run for a while (at least 30 minutes)
4. Check your balance with ./check-wallet-balance
5. Experiment with the software
6. Report any bugs you find!

Thank you for helping test Dilithion!

================================================================
  QUANTUM-RESISTANT CRYPTOGRAPHY
================================================================

Dilithion protects against "Capture Now, Decrypt Later" attacks
where adversaries record encrypted data today to decrypt it when
quantum computers become available.

By using NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (FIPS 204),
Dilithion ensures your transactions remain secure even in a
future with powerful quantum computers.

Happy mining!
