üöÄ DILITHION TESTNET IS NOW LIVE! üöÄ

After months of development and security hardening, I'm excited to announce that Dilithion's public testnet is open for community testing!

Dilithion is a post-quantum cryptocurrency built from scratch with NIST-approved CRYSTALS-Dilithium3 signatures. When quantum computers arrive, current cryptocurrencies will be vulnerable. Dilithion is quantum-safe from day one.

‚úÖ 93% test pass rate
‚úÖ All critical bugs fixed
‚úÖ Security hardening complete
‚úÖ Ready for testing

JOIN THE TESTNET:
üìñ Guide: github.com/WillBarton888/dilithion/blob/main/TESTNET-LAUNCH.md
