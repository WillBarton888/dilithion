## Security Status - CORRECTED ASSESSMENT

### Updated Score: 8/10 (A- Grade)

**VERIFIED ‚úÖ - Working Correctly:**
1. ‚úÖ NIST cryptography (Dilithium3, SHA-3)
2. ‚úÖ PBKDF2-SHA3 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
3. ‚úÖ Memory wiping (memset throughout)
4. ‚úÖ Connection limits (125 max, DoS protection)
5. ‚úÖ **Wallet auto-lock** (timeout-based, line 566-567)
6. ‚úÖ Input validation (basic, needs expansion)
7. ‚úÖ Buffer overflow protection (C++ std::vector/string)

**GAPS ‚ö†Ô∏è - Documented, Acceptable for Experimental Launch:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting NOT implemented (documented in TASK-005)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Comprehensive input validation incomplete (partial coverage)

**Assessment:**
- **Cryptography:** A++ (Excellent)
- **Wallet Security:** A+ (Excellent)
- **Network Security:** B+ (Good, rate limiting missing)
- **Overall:** **ACCEPTABLE FOR EXPERIMENTAL LAUNCH**

**Recommendation:** Launch with current security + experimental disclaimers

## Critical Decisions Made

### 1. Currency Unit: "ions" ‚úÖ
- 1 DIL = 100,000,000 ions
- Replaces "satoshis" terminology
- Thematic fit with "Dilithion"
- All code and docs updated

### 2. No 1% Dev Fund ‚úÖ
- Maintain 100% fair launch
- 99% to miners would still be "fair" but adds complexity
- Simpler messaging: "100% proof-of-work"
- Genesis reward (50 DIL) is developer's only allocation

### 3. Accept Geographic Electricity Variance ‚úÖ
- Cannot equalize without centralization
- Focus on ASIC-resistance (RandomX) as main equalizer
- Bitcoin's proven approach
- Australian miners can use solar (advantage)

### 4. Accept Botnet Risk ‚úÖ
- Monero's experience: 30-40% estimated botnet hashrate
- Trade-off: CPU accessibility vs botnet abuse
- ASIC centralization is worse
- Community monitoring + exchange blacklisting

### 5. Australian Legal Approach ‚úÖ
- Add disclaimers (not exchange, not custodial)
- Consult lawyer before mainnet (November-December)
- Register ABN (business structure)
- Educational positioning (not investment advice)

## Outstanding Issues to Fix

### Priority 1 (Before Website Upload) üî¥
1. **Regenerate whitepaper PDF** - User action required
2. **Create Terms of Service page** - Legal requirement
3. **Create Privacy Policy page** - Legal requirement
4. **Test manual wallet encryption** - Verify it works

### Priority 2 (Before Mainnet Launch) üü°
5. **Implement RPC rate limiting** - Security improvement
6. **Comprehensive input validation audit** - Review all RPC methods
7. **Replace memset() with memory_cleanse()** - Compiler-proof wiping
8. **Consult Australian crypto lawyer** - Legal compliance
9. **Register business structure (ABN)** - Legal compliance
10. **Professional security audit** - External validation

### Priority 3 (Post-Launch Enhancements) üü¢
11. **HD wallet implementation** - Seed phrase backup
12. **Layer 2 research** - Scaling solutions
13. **Exchange applications** - Liquidity
