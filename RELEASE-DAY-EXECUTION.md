# Release Day Execution - Quick Reference
**When genesis mining completes, follow these steps in order**

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (When Mining Completes)

### Step 1: Verify Mining Success (2 minutes)
```bash
# Check output shows:
# "Verification passed! Genesis block is valid."

# Record these values:
NONCE=[value from output]
HASH=[value from output]
HASHES_TRIED=[value from output]
```

### Step 2: Update Genesis Header (1 minute)
```bash
# Edit src/node/genesis.h
nano src/node/genesis.h

# Change line:
const uint32_t NONCE = 0;
# To:
const uint32_t NONCE = [NONCE_VALUE];
```

### Step 3: Rebuild Binaries (5 minutes)
```bash
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion && make clean && make"
```

### Step 4: Verify Genesis Block (1 minute)
```bash
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion && ./genesis_gen"
# Should show correct nonce and hash
```

### Step 5: Commit Genesis Block (2 minutes)
```bash
git add src/node/genesis.h
git commit -m "Add mined genesis block for mainnet launch

Genesis Block:
- Timestamp: 1767225600 (Jan 1, 2026 00:00:00 UTC)
- Nonce: $NONCE
- Hash: $HASH
- Hashes Tried: $HASHES_TRIED

Verified with CheckProofOfWork() - ready for mainnet launch."

git tag v1.0.0-genesis
git push origin standalone-implementation
git push origin v1.0.0-genesis
```

**Elapsed Time: ~11 minutes**

---

## üî® BUILD & PACKAGE (30-60 minutes)

### Step 6: Build Release Package
```bash
chmod +x build-release.sh
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion && ./build-release.sh v1.0.0"
```

Expected output:
- `releases/v1.0.0/dilithion-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- `releases/v1.0.0/SHA256SUMS`

### Step 7: Test Release Package (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /tmp
tar -xzf /mnt/c/Users/will/dilithion/releases/v1.0.0/dilithion-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd dilithion-v1.0.0-linux-x64
./bin/dilithion-node --help
./bin/genesis_gen
```

Verify:
- [  ] Binaries execute
- [  ] Genesis hash matches
- [  ] Documentation included

**Elapsed Time: ~40-60 minutes total**

```

### Step 9: Create GitHub Release
```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
# sudo apt install gh

# Login
gh auth login

# Create release
gh release create v1.0.0 \
  --title "Dilithion v1.0.0 - Mainnet Launch" \
  --notes-file RELEASE-NOTES-v1.0.0.md \
  releases/v1.0.0/*
```

### Step 10: Verify Release

## üåç WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT (10 minutes)

### Step 11: Update Website Download Links
```bash
# Edit website/index.html
# Change download button hrefs from:

# To actual download links:
href="https://github.com/WillBarton888/dilithion/releases/download/v1.0.0/dilithion-v1.0.0-windows-x64.zip"
# etc.
```

### Step 12: Deploy Website
**Option A: GitHub Pages**

git checkout -b gh-pages
git add website/*
git commit -m "Deploy website v1.0.0"
git push origin gh-pages
```

**Option B: Netlify**
- Drag `website/` folder to netlify.com
- Configure custom domain: dilithion.org

### Step 13: Verify Website
Visit your deployment URL and check:
- [  ] All download links work
- [  ] Countdown shows correct date
- [  ] All pages load
- [  ] Mobile responsive

**Elapsed Time: ~60-80 minutes total**
